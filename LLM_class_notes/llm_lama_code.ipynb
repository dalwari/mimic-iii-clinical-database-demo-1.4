Her INR was checked and she\nwas started on Heparin. On [**6-16**] she was brought to the operating\nroom where she underwent a mitral valve replacement and maze\nprocedure. Please see operative report for surgical details.\nFollowing surgery she was transferred to the CSRU for invasive\nmonitoring in stable condition. Later on op day she was weaned\nfrom sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated. She\nwas weaned off all drip and started on beta blockers and\ndiuretics. On this day she had several episodes of bradycardia\nand beta blockade was temporarily held. On post-op day two she\nappeared to be doing well and was transferred to the SDU. Chest\ntubes were removed on this day and epicardial pacing wires on\npost-op day three. Coumadin and Amiodarone were restarted but\nshe remained in sinus rhythm. Physical therapy followed patient\nduring entire post-op course for strength and mobility. She\ncontinued to improve quite well and was discharged home with VNA\nservices and the appropriate follow-up appointments on post-op\nday four.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nPremarin, Synthroid, Atenolol, Cozaar, Coumadin, Folate,\nAspririn, Amiodarone\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.

He becomes short of breath when he carries his 22\nmonth old daughter for more than three or four block.  He\nalso gets short of breath when climbing one flight of stairs\nor walking 15 minutes on a treadmill.

The patient has had bilateral\ncarotid stenosis.  On [**2-21**] while he was sitting in a chair he\ndeveloped sudden onset of right arm and leg numbness,\nfollowed by right arm and leg weakness.  He also had\ndifficulty speaking.  He was admitted to [**Hospital3 **]\nand underwent a left carotid endarterectomy on [**2-26**] and\nafterwards began having severe left sided headache behind his\nleft eye that lasted for hours and was constant.\nNevertheless, he visited [**Hospital3 **] for continued\nheadaches and nausea and vomiting.  During one of those\nvisits he had a contortion of his right face and bilateral\narm jerking and was started on Dilantin with presumptive\ndiagnosis of seizures.  He has recovered from that event when\nwas again discharged home.  On [**3-13**] he again presented with\npersistent headaches, confusion and inability to talk.  He\nhad difficulty getting his words out.  He had a head CT at\n[**Hospital3 **] which showed a linear hyperintense region\nin the left central temporal lobe but also other lesions in\nthe left posterior parietal lobes.  At that time he was\ntransferred to the [**Hospital1 69**].  MRI\nof his head showed left MCA/ACA and left MCA/PCA watershed\nstrokes with acute and subacute hemorrhage conversions.  It\nwas thought at that time that he had extended his watershed\ninfarcts after carotid endarterectomy leading to a carotid\nhyperperfusion syndrome.  The patient was discharged from the\nneurologic Intensive Care Unit to a rehab facility.  On\nThursday, [**2133-3-26**], patient's wife noticed erythema on\npatient's face.  On [**3-27**] the visiting nurse [**First Name (Titles) 8706**] [**Last Name (Titles) 11282**] of\na rash on his arms as well.  The patient was noted to be\nfebrile and was admitted to the [**Company 191**] Firm.  In the EW,\npatient's Dilantin was discontinued and he was given Tegretol\ninstead.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Left CEA in [**2133-2-16**].  2) CVA in\n[**2133-2-16**].  3) Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.  4)  CAD.  5)\nPVD.  6) Hypercholesterolemia.  7) History of amaurosis\nfugax.  8) Status post lymph node removal.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  On admission, Lopressor 25 mg po bid, Dilantin\n200 mg po tid, Prilosec 40 mg po q day, Lipitor, Ambien.\n\nALLERGIES:  Iodine.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives in [**Location 3146**], tobacco since\n[**2126**], one pint of alcohol per day.  The patient works as a\ncarpenter.\n\nFAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY:  CAD.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature 98.3, pulse\n86, blood pressure 94/65, respiratory rate 18, saturations\n96% on room air.  In general, alert, oriented times three, no\napparent distress.  HEENT:  Pupils are equal, round, and\nreactive to light, mucus membranes moist, oropharynx clear.\nNo lymphadenopathy.  Cardiovascular, regular rate and rhythm,\nno murmurs.  Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.\nAbdomen soft, nontender, non distended, positive bowel\nsounds.  Extremities, no cyanosis, erythema, edema.  Neuro,\ncranial nerves II through XII intact.  Skin red maculopapular\nblanching erythema on face, torso and extremities, sparing\nthe soles.  Bilateral lower extremity petechiae, no\nsignificant oral lesions noted.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:\n1.  Derm:  Over the course of patient's stay on [**Company 191**] Firm,\npatient had rigors and fevers of up to 101 degree.  The\npatient was initially continued on Tegretol.  The patient had\nworsening rash throughout his torso with lip swelling and\ntongue swelling.  The patient did not experience any\nrespiratory difficulties throughout the course of his stay on\nthe [**Company 191**] service.  A derm consult was obtained.  The\ndermatology team recommended discontinuing Tegretol.  Their\nthought was that the patient's symptoms were secondary to his\nhypersensitivity to Dilantin.  The patient was treated\nsymptomatically with IV fluids, Zantac, Benadryl and Synalar\ncream.  The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive\nCare Unit overnight for observation given risk of respiratory\ndistress.  [**Hospital **] Medical Intensive Care Unit stay was\nuneventful.  Skin biopsy was also consistent with\nhypersensitivity reaction.  Over the course of patient's stay\nin the hospital, patient's rash started to improve with\ndecreasing erythema and edema.\n\n2.  Neuro:  Patient was seen by neurology service.  They\nrecommended stopping all anti-epileptic medications since\nthey thought that his symptoms were likely secondary to\ncarotid reperfusion syndrome and anti-seizure medications are\nnot necessarily beneficial under these circumstances.\n\n3.  GI:  Patient's LFTs were slightly elevated during his\nadmission.  The patient's Lipitor was held due to increased\nLFTs.  His increased LFTs were likely secondary to Dilantin.\nPatient to follow-up with his PCP to make sure LFTs are\ntrending down and before restarting Lipitor.\n\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:\n1.  Dilantin hypersensitivity reaction.\n\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  [**Doctor First Name **] 60 mg po bid, Zantac 150 mg\npo bid, Synalar ointment, Eucerin cream.  Discharged to home.\npatient to follow-up with PCP next week as well as with\ndermatology.

Pt passed away [**8-12**] w/o\nintervention in the presence of family and pastoral care.\n\n# Hypoxemic respiratory failure.  Mr. [**Known lastname 24413**] required a NRB the\nED and was easily weaned to 6L NC on arrival to the MICU. He was\nfound to have a right pleural effusion on CXR with findings\nconcerning for HAP. He was started on Cefepime, Vancomycin and\nflagyl. He was transferred to the general medical floor and his\nantibiotic coverage was adjusted to levofloxacin and vancomycin\non [**7-29**]. A thoracentesis was performed on [**8-1**] that was found to\nbe transudative. Following thoracentesis, on [**8-2**] his\nrespiratory staus decompensated and he again had an increased\noxygen requirement. This decompensation could possibly have\nresulted from worsened pulmonary edema. He was transferred to\nthe MICU on [**8-3**] where he required a face tent in addition to\nthe nasal canula for oxygenation. Mr. [**Known lastname 24413**] was found to have\nsignifcant pulmonary edema on CXR and a renal consult was\nobtained to help guide diuresis. On [**8-3**] and [**8-4**] he recieved\n10mg metolazone 30min prior to lasix 80mg IV to achieve adequate\ndiuresis. He was weaned from the face tent to 3L NC and upon\nclinical stabilization was transferred to the medicine floor on\n[**2148-8-4**].\n.\nOn the medicine floor he was continued on 3L NC, with continued\nsats to mid-90's during the day. However, on the morning of\n[**2148-8-8**], pt had desats to mid-70s during a nebulizer treatment\nand had been off O2. He was placed back on 3L NC, and quickly\nreturned to O2 sats in the mid-90s. However, pt's breathing\nappeared more labored, and the MICU team was consulted.\nThoracentesis performed in MICU showed Labs were consistent with\ntransudative effusion: serum Protein ratio 0.45, LDH ratio 0.43,\n375 WBC, pH 7.42. Cytology negative for malignant cells.\nIncidentally discovered liver masses on RUQ u/s (marked alk phos\nelevation). Sono also positive for portal vein thrombosis and\nIVC thrombus suggestive of either an infiltrative hepatocellular\ncarcinoma or peripheral cholangiocarcinoma. Hepatology was\nconsulted. Serologies negative for HCV, HBV, but AFP was\nelevated at [**Numeric Identifier 24742**]. Recurrent pleural effusions attributed to\nmetastases from liver primary ca.\n.\nPt was stabilized and transferred back to medicine floor. He was\ntransferred back to MICU 2nd time for hypoxemic resp failure,\nworsened pulm edema. He was diuresied but serum Cr increased.\nRenal consulted. Pt started on started on octreotide and albumin\nfor suspected HRS. Called [**8-7**] for SOB but quickly returned to\nbaseline. He was stabilized and transferred back to medicine\nfloor with intention to treat comfort and minimize medical\nmanagement.\n.\n.\n# Palliative Care/End of life issues: Mr. [**Known lastname 24413**] was found to\nhave liver malignancy likely HCC with metastases. On [**8-8**] tumor\nboard consensus was that there are no treatment options that can\nbe offered given his clinical picture. Pt made DNR DNI with\nfocus on comfort. 1 of 4 of his children prefers inpt to home\nhospice. HCP is daughter [**Name (NI) 24743**]. Palliative care is following\nand facilitating transfer to hospice, likely home hospice\nservices. There is a prelim referral to Old [**Hospital **] Hospice.\nPt schedule for placement of palliative pleurx catheter for\nrecurrent R sided effusions. Plan is to discharge to home with\nhospice care, pending palliative care recs and family wishes on\nMonday [**2148-8-12**]. Case management and social work aware. Pastoral\ncare visit requested via VM left on [**2148-8-10**] by primary team at\nrequest of daughter. The patient passed away on [**8-12**] in the\npresence of pastoral care.\n.\n# Abdominal distension.  Mr. [**Known lastname 24413**] was found to have\nsignificant abdominal distention. Serial exams did not indicate\nan acute intraabdominal process. Exam was non-tender. An\nabdominal U/S on [**8-1**] demonstrated liver masses, which in the\nsetting of cirrhosis and transaminitis with AFP of >14,000 is\nparticularly concerning for HCC. A CT biopsy was delayed because\nof his coagulopathy with a climbing INR of 3.2 likely [**2-13**] liver\ndysfunction. In addition, an abdominal MRI was also delayed\nbecuase of his tenuous renal function with a climbing Cr of 4.1.\n.\nOn the medicine floors, heme/onc was consulted. Per their recs,\na biopsy was not necessarily needed to diagnose HCC in this\ngentleman with known cirrhosis and AFP of 15,000. The pt was\ndiscussed at tumor board on [**2148-8-8**], and consensus was that\nthere are no treatment options that can be offered given his\nclinical picture. Pt made DNR DNI with focus on comfort.\nCurrently denies any abd discomfort, feelings of constipation or\npressure or difficulty breathing.\n.\n# Cellulitis: Mr. [**Known lastname 24413**] was continued on Vancomycin,\nLevofloxacin as above. Discontinued in MICU after diagnosis of\nmalignant hepatic process and non-infectious pleural effusion.\nWound care was consulted and recommended wraps, elevation of\nlegs. He continued to be afebrile, but had an elevated white\ncount to 11.9 on [**8-7**]. Labs were not drawn after [**8-9**] and goals\nof care concerned primarily for comfort and palliative medical\nmanagement.\n.\n# Acute on chronic renal failure: During his ICU stay, his serum\ncreatinine began to climb from his baseline of 2.2, up to 4.0.\nNephrology was consulted on [**2148-8-3**] who questioned if this could\nbe hepatorenal syndrome. Of note, prior to his transfer to the\nICU, he had received one dose of albumin on the medicine floors,\nbut had not had a true albumin challenge. The ICU team attempted\ndiuresis with IV lasix and metolazone; however, he remained net\npositive during his MICU stay. Upon transfer from 2nd MICU stay\nback to medicine floors, his creatinine and BUN continued to\nclimb. Diuresis was held. He was maintained on fluid restriction\nto 1200ml, low phos, low sodium diet.\n.\n# Hypervolemic hyponatremia: FeNa<1%, likely secondary to known\ncirrhosis, and renal failure. His sodium was trended, pt\nremained asymptomatic.\n.\n# Atrial fibrillation: During his admission, his coumadin was\nheld given a  supratherapeutic INR likely [**2-13**] hepatic failure.\nHe was started on metoprolol 12.5mg qid for rate control and\nincreased dose to 37.5mg for palliation of pulmo edema and SOB.\nOf note, pt has been receiving albuterol neb treatments for his\nhypoxia.\n.\n# DVTs: He was started on heparin gtt, and his home coumadin was\nheld because of a supratherapeutic INR. The heparin was\ndiscontinued on [**2148-8-5**], given elevated INR of 3.2.\n.\n# DM II. Pt has history of hypoglycemia necessitating\nhospitalization. His serum glucose was actively titrated with\ninsulin while admitted to the MICU. He was continued on insulin\nsliding scale after transfer to the medicine floor. Fingerstick\nschedule was reduced to QAM and QPM monitoring for pt comfort.\nMaintained on lantus and humalog sliding scale.\n.\n# HTN. He was normotensive while admitted to the MICU thus his\nhome BP regimen was held.\n.\n# HL. He was continued on his home dose of simvastatin\ninitially, and was discontinued after transfer from MICU to\nmedicine floors with goal of care for short term, comfort and\npalliation.\n.\n# Iron deficiency anemia: His hct remained stable, with no s/s\nof bleeding.\n.\n# CAD.  His EKG had ST depressions, but he was asymptomatic. In\naddition, this troponins were negative for an MI.\n.\n# CHF. Elevated BNP suggesting CHF decompensation.\n.\n# EtOH abuse: Last use 2 weeks PTA. He was given\nthiamine/MVI/folate. CIWA was not necessary.\n\nMedications on Admission:\n1. Aspirin 81 mg\n2.

She does not complain of\nany chest pain, but does report progressive shortness of\nbreath with exertion that has been getting worse over the\npast year.  She finds that she needs to stop and rest to\ncatch her breath while cleaning the house and becomes very\nshort of breath in doing things such as ascending a flight of\nstairs.  Her last echocardiogram in [**2147-8-21**] demonstrated\na mean aortic valve gradient of 45 mmHg and a peak gradient\nof 70 mmHg with an estimated valve area of 0.5 square cm.\nShe had a cardiac catheterization that demonstrated a 50%\nlesion in the LAD and mid right coronary artery lesion.  At\ntime of catheterization, she had a mean gradient to 60 mmHg.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\n1.  Aortic stenosis\n2.  Hypertension\n3.  Hypercholesterolemia\n\nMEDICATIONS:\n1.  Aspirin 325 mg po q day\n2.  Nifedipine 60 mg po bid\n3.  Lopressor 50 mg po bid\n4.  Vasotec 20 mg po bid\n5.  Hydrochlorothiazide\n\nALLERGIES:  The patient is not allergic to any medicines.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nVITAL SIGNS:  Her heart rate is 54.  Her blood pressure is\n153/69.  Her preoperative weight is 46.8 kg.\nGENERAL:  She is an older woman in no acute distress.\nHEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Her pupils are equally\nround and reactive to light.  Neck is supple, good range of\nmotion, no tenderness or swelling.  There is no jugular\nvenous distention.\nCHEST:  Distant breath sounds, but is otherwise clear to\nauscultation.  She has a hard gumball size nodule in her\nright breast.\nHEART:  Normal S1 and S2 with a loud blowing systolic murmur\nheard best at the left sternal border.\nABDOMEN:  Soft with no active bowel sounds.  No masses, no\naortic pulsations or abdominal bruits.\nEXTREMITIES:  Warm with slightly cool toes.\nNEUROLOGIC:  She is awake and oriented with equal strength\nthroughout.\n\nADMISSION LABS:  Her white count is 6.9, hematocrit 36.8,\nplatelets 186.  BUN and creatinine are 19 and 1.2.  Her\npotassium is 4.4.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted through same day\nadmissions and on [**2148-4-23**], was taken to the Operating\nRoom where she had a two vessel coronary artery bypass graft\nwith a tissue aortic valve replacement.  Her grafts are left\ninternal mammary artery to LAD and saphenous vein graft to\ndistal right coronary artery.  In addition, she has a #19 RSR\npericardial valve.  Her procedure itself was unremarkable\npostoperatively.  She was taken intubated on Levophed and\npropofol drips to the Cardiac Surgery Intensive Care Unit.\nThat night she had what we considered to be an enormous\nvolume requirement and had to be transfused with 2 units of\npacked red blood cells, 2 units of fresh frozen plasma and\nanother 3500 cc of crystalloid.  In addition, she required\nmilrinone in addition to her Levophed.  All of this for\ncardiac index swan numbers that continued to diminish.  She\ndid have some atrial and ventricular ectopy and was started\non intravenous amiodarone.\n\nBy the first postoperative day, she remained intubated, but\nlater on that day was extubated.  She never had to be\nreintubated, but she did require BIPAP on that evening for in\nincrease work up breathing.  By the second postoperative day,\nshe was maintaining her saturations on 100% nonrebreather and\nover the next day was able to be weaned to a face tent and 4\nliters of nasal cannula.  She spent several days in the\nIntensive Care Unit because of her tenuous pulmonary status.\nIn addition, she had several bouts of atrial fibrillation\nwith rates anywhere from 80 to 130.  Each time these\ncorrected with a little bit of intravenous Lopressor or oral\nLopressor and intravenous amiodarone.  She continued to have\nthese paroxysmal episodes of atrial fibrillation for about\nthe first five postoperative days.  However, since that time,\nno further episodes were seen and it was believed that she\nhad become therapeutic on her amiodarone.  For this reason,\nshe did not need to be anticoagulated.\n\nThe patient remained in the Intensive Care Unit for a total\nof nine days during this time.  We used her intensive\nmonitoring setting to properly diurese her and observe her\nfor any further arrhythmia.  On the ninth postoperative day,\nshe was transferred to the floor without incident.  From\nthere she remained stable and discharge planning was\ninitiated.  This discharge summary was dictated on [**5-3**]\nin the anticipation that the patient may go to rehabilitation\non the following day.\n\nThe patient was transferred to rehabilitation on the\nfollowing medications:\n1.  Lopressor 25 mg po bid, hold for heart rate less than 55,\nsystolic blood pressure less than 100\n2.  Colace 100 mg po bid\n3.  Aspirin 325 mg po q day\n4.  Amiodarone 400 mg po bid x7 days, then 400 mg po q day\n5.  Protonix 40 mg po q day\n6.  Heparin 5000 units subcutaneous [**Hospital1 **]\n7.  Klonopin 0.25 mg po q hs prn\n8.  Lasix 40 mg po bid x7 days\n9.  Potassium chloride 20 milliequivalents po bid x7 days\n10. Tylenol 650 mg po q 4 to 6 hours prn\n11. Colace 100 mg po bid\n12. Atrovent metered dose inhaler 2 puffs qid\n\nAfter seven days, the patient's Lasix and potassium may or\nmay not need to continue.  Of note, she is not presently on\nher Vasotec and hydrochlorothiazide that she took\npreoperatively.  These may need to be restarted in the next\nseven days.\n\nThe patient is instructed to follow up with her primary care\nphysician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 27542**], in approximately two weeks.\nIn addition, she is to follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1537**] in\napproximately four weeks.\n\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:\n1.

Please see operative report for surgical details.\\nFollowing surgery she was transferred to the CSRU for invasive\\nmonitoring in stable condition. Later on op day she was weaned\\nfrom sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated. She\\nwas weaned off all drip and started on beta blockers and\\ndiuretics. On this day she had several episodes of bradycardia\\nand beta blockade was temporarily held. On post-op day two she\\nappeared to be doing well and was transferred to the SDU. Chest\\ntubes were removed on this day and epicardial pacing wires on\\npost-op day three. Coumadin and Amiodarone were restarted but\\nshe remained in sinus rhythm. Physical therapy followed patient\\nduring entire post-op course for strength and mobility.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76-year-old male who had been hospitalized at the [**Hospital1 190**] from [**10-11**] through [**10-19**] of [**2101**] after undergoing a left femoral-AT bypass graft and was subsequently discharged to a rehabilitation facility.  On [**2101-10-20**], he presented again to the [**Hospital1 346**] after being found to have a systolic blood pressure in the 70s and no urine output for 17 hours. A Foley catheter placed at the rehabilitation facility yielded 100 cc of murky/brown urine.  There may also have been purulent discharge at the penile meatus at this time.  On presentation to the Emergency Department, the patient was without subjective complaints.  In the Emergency Department, he was found to have systolic blood pressure of 85.  He was given 6 liters of intravenous fluids and transiently started on dopamine for a systolic blood pressure in the 80.s  PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is retired and had been living at home with his wife prior to his admission to the hospital on [**2101-10-11**]; he had been living at [**Hospital3 1761**] for the day prior to admission.  He is a social drinker and has a 40-pack-year smoking history; although, he quit smoking 20 years ago.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Initial physical examination revealed temperature was 96.1 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate was 83, blood pressure was 124/42 (following administration of 3 liters of normal saline), respiratory was 24, and his oxygen saturation was 100% on 2 liters nasal cannula.  His heart had a regular rate and rhythm.  There were normal first and second heart sounds.  There was a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, and there were no rubs or gallops. His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended, and there were hypoactive bowel sounds.  He had a palpable bypass graft pulse, [**Hospital3 17394**] dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses bilaterally; and his surgical incision was clean, dry, and intact.  Please note that the above examination was done by the Vascular Surgery team, which was the team that was initially planning to admit the patient to the hospital.  PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  On initial laboratory evaluation the patient had a white blood cell count of 12.7, hematocrit was 30.2, and platelets were 282,000.  His PT was 13.5, PTT was 30.7, and INR was 1.3.  His serum chemistries revealed sodium was 136, potassium was 5.4, chloride was 99, bicarbonate was 25, blood urea nitrogen was 53, creatinine was 3.2, and blood glucose was 91.  His calcium was 8.2, magnesium was 2.4, and phosphate was 4.8.  Blood cultures drawn on admission were pending, but ultimately negative.  A urine culture taken on admission was initially pending, but ultimately grew out yeast.  A sputum culture taken on admission was also initially pending, but ultimately also grew out yeast.  RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  His admission chest x-ray demonstrated stable prominence of the right main pulmonary artery; no focal areas of consolidation; overall stable appearance of the chest compared with a [**2101-10-15**] study.  No radiographic evidence of congestive heart failure or pneumonia.  His admission electrocardiogram demonstrated a sinus rhythm, nonspecific inferior/lateral T wave changes, low QRS voltages in the limb leads, and T wave changes in V5 and V6 when compared with an electrocardiogram dated [**2101-10-12**].  An initial abdominal CT was a limited noncontrast examination that demonstrated diffuse vascular calcifications.  No evidence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm or free fluid, incompletely imaged coronary artery calcification, a simple left renal cyst, sigmoid diverticulosis, and an enlarged and partially calcified prostate gland.  HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:  1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was initially admitted to the Vascular Intensive Care Unit with hypotension, decreased urine output, and acute renal failure; most likely secondary to a presumed gram-negative urosepsis (although there were never any positive culture data to confirm this diagnosis).  While boarding in the Medical Intensive Care Unit on the night of admission, the patient had a sudden cardiorespiratory arrest.  He was resuscitated with epinephrine, lidocaine, and direct current cardioversion times four.  He was also intubate for airway protection.  Following these measures, the patient returned to a sinus rhythm with a systolic blood pressure of approximately 100; the total time elapsed from the beginning of the arrest to the return of a pulse was approximately 16 minutes.  He subsequently required double pressors to maintain his blood pressure.  An echocardiogram performed at the bedside demonstrated a trivial pericardial effusion and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 20% to 25% in the setting of tachycardia and a hyperdynamic right ventricle; suggesting elevated right-sided filling pressures.  Although the definitive etiology of this arrest remained unknown, the most likely trigger was a non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, as his troponin values were elevated to greater than 50 following his arrest.  A repeat echocardiogram done on [**2101-10-21**] demonstrated mild left atrial dilation, an ejection fraction of 15% to 20%, resting regional wall motion abnormalities including inferior, mid, and apical left ventricular akinesis, depressed right ventricular systolic function, and moderate mitral regurgitation.  Compared with the prior study of [**2101-10-20**]; the left ventricular function was unchanged.  There was moderate mitral regurgitation, and the right ventricular function appeared worse.  On [**2101-10-21**], the patient was loaded with amiodarone and was subsequently started on oral amiodarone.  The following day, he was started on heparin intravenously given his elevated serum troponin to greater than 50; this medication was continued for 72 hours.  Given his elevated troponins and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, the patient was a candidate for cardiac catheterization.  After discussions between the Medical Intensive Care Unit team and the patient's family, however, the decision was made to not pursue further invasive procedures given that the patient had been made do not resuscitate/do not intubate following the resuscitation mentioned above, and his family no longer wished for aggressive resuscitating measures.  By [**2101-10-23**], he was off pressors and he was restarted on a beta blocker and ACE inhibitor at low doses.  On the evening of [**2101-10-25**], the patient complained of substernal chest pain that was relieved by NPG SL and morphine.  He also had ST segment depressions in V2 and V3 that reverted to baseline after the resolution of his pain. Therefore, the patient was again started on heparin; although, this was discontinued on [**2101-10-26**] when the patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac enzymes.  He again had substernal chest pain on [**2101-10-27**]; although, he had no electrocardiogram changes, and he again ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac enzymes.  By hospital day four, the patient began to develop evidence of congestive heart failure given his aggressive fluid resuscitation, and gentle diuresis with furosemide was begun. By the time of his transfer to the General Medicine Service on [**2101-10-26**], the patient was still significantly volume overloaded following his aggressive fluid resuscitation in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  Therefore, he was continued on the program of gentle diuresis given that he was having signs and symptoms of right-sided congestive heart failure.  He achieved adequate diuresis by the time of his discharge to rehabilitation, as his oxygen saturation was greater than 95% on 2 liters nasal cannula.  2.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE/SEPSIS:  The patient was started on gentamicin and piperacillin/tazobactam in addition to the levofloxacin, metronidazole, and vancomycin he was already taking for right lower extremity cellulitis prior to admission for empiric coverage of a presumed gram-negative urosepsis, and he was aggressively hydrated with intravenous fluids.  On [**2101-10-21**], his levofloxacin and metronidazole was discontinued, and he was started on fluconazole given the growth of yeast on urine culture.  He was taken off of gentamicin on hospital day three, and his fluconazole was discontinued on hospital day five (as per the Infectious Disease Service).  He was taken off of vancomycin on [**2101-10-28**], and his piperacillin/tazobactam was discontinued on [**2101-10-29**].  Despite the presumption of a gram-negative urosepsis precipitating this admission, the patient did not have any positive blood or urine cultures aside from the growth of yeast in two urine cultures noted above.  He remained afebrile both before and after discontinuation of his antibiotics, and he was found to be Clostridium difficile negative on [**2101-10-28**].  3.  PULMONARY:  As noted above, the patient was intubated and he was extubated on [**2101-10-24**].  He subsequently developed wheezing and mild hypoxia; most likely secondary to cardiac asthma and fluid overload in the setting of his aggressive fluid resuscitation.  He was gently diuresed toward the end of his hospitalization, and by the time of his he was maintaining an oxygen saturation of greater than 95% on 2 liters nasal cannula, intermittent ipratropium nebulizers, and chest physical therapy for clearance of his respiratory secretions.  4.  RENAL:  The patient presented with acute renal failure and prerenal azotemia that rapidly resolved following fluid resuscitation.  By the time of discharge, his serum creatinine was stable and at his preadmission baseline.  5.  NUTRITION:  The patient was found to be profoundly malnourished with a serum albumin of 1.8 on admission.  Once he was extubated and taking orals, he performed poorly on a modified barium swallowing study and was started on a thin liquid, ground-solid diet with whole medication tablets, small bites and sips, upright posture with meals, and aspiration precautions.  He was also given ProMod shakes with and between meals for nutritional supplementation of his heart-healthy/diabetic diet.  6.  VASCULAR:  The patient's operative incisions and foot ulcers continued to heal throughout this admission.  He was started on an multivitamin, vitamin C, and zinc for improved wound healing.  7.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells on [**2101-10-27**] to maintain a hematocrit of greater than 30 given his history of severe coronary artery disease.  His hematocrit subsequently remained stable.  CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.  DISCHARGE STATUS:  [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] rehabilitation facility.  DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  1.  Cardiorespiratory arrest.  2.

The LCX had a 90% stenosis of the OM1 proximally and a 50% followed by a 70% stenosis in the proximal and mid segment of the OM2. The RCA had a 90% stenosis in the mid PDA. 2.  Limited resting hemodynamics revealed mildly to moderately elevated left sided filling pressures (LVEDP was 18 mm Hg). Systemic arterial pressure was normal (aortic pressure was 121/73 mm Hg).  There was no significant gradient across the aortic valve upon pullback of the catheter from the left ventricle to the ascending aorta. 3.  Left ventriculography revealed a contrast calculated ejection fraction of 65%.  No mitral regurgitation was noted. 4. Bilateral selective renal angiography demonstrated widely patent renal arteries. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. Three vessel coronary artery disease. 2. Normal left ventricular systolic function. 3. Mildly to moderately elevated left sided filling pressures. 4. No angiographically apparent renal artery stenosis. .

COMPARISON: [**2131-5-4**]  INDICATION: Chest tube removal.  Various lines and tubes have been removed since the prior radiograph, and a very small left apical pneumothorax has developed. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are within normal limits for postoperative status of the patient. Small pleural effusions and minor bibasilar atelectasis are noted. These findings are superimposed upon subtle likely more chronic peripheral and basilar interstitial lung disease.  On the lateral view, small air-fluid level is present in the retrosternal region likely representing an anterior hydropneumothorax, and additional air is present in the retrosternal region, an expected postoperative finding given the time interval since surgery.  IMPRESSION: Small left pneumothorax following tube removal. Bibasilar atelectasis and small pleural effusions.  DR.

It began the night prior to admission when he took a deep breath and noticed a pain between his scapulae.  It became progressively worse, to the point where he was unable to take deep breaths.  He had no recent cough, fever, chills, chest pain, headaches, nausea, vomiting, lightheadedness, weakness or dysuria.  His ambulation was limited by claudication, not dyspnea on exertion.  He denies baseline shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, or lower extremity edema.  He had a recent right upper lobe pneumonia in [**Month (only) 205**], status post a seven day course of levofloxacin with an additional admission in [**Month (only) 216**], as his pneumonia did not clear.  At that point, he had a parapneumonic effusion that was tapped and showed to be exudative.  He received a second course of antibiotics, namely Levaquin and Flagyl, at that time and underwent bronchoscopy to look for an obstructive lesion.  The bronchoscopy revealed an apical right upper lobe endobronchial lesion, but the biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage were negative for malignant cells.  He was followed up by his pulmonologist as an outpatient in [**Month (only) 359**], and was doing well.  He was asymptomatic at that time.  The plan was to repeat a CT scan in [**Month (only) 1096**] to look for resolution of his air space disease.  He presented to the Emergency Room, where he was febrile, and a chest x-ray showed opacification of his right lung, questionable infiltrate vs. effusion.  He was started on levofloxacin and Flagyl and admitted.  PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1.  Right upper lobe pneumonia described above, status post one seven day course of levofloxacin and one 14 day course of levofloxacin and Flagyl 2.  History of congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction.  An echocardiogram in [**2152-12-30**] showed an ejection fraction of 55%. 3.  Hypertension complicated by chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.8 to 2.4, complicated by anemia on Epogen 4.  Iron-deficiency anemia status post an esophagogastroduodenoscopy in [**2154-7-31**] that showed a gastric arteriovenous malformation status post BiPAP cautery. A colonoscopy in [**2154-7-31**] was negative.  Colonoscopy in [**2153-6-30**] revealed an adenomatous polyp that was removed. The colonoscopy in [**2153-6-30**] was done in the setting of a gastrointestinal bleed. 5.  Gastrointestinal bleed x 2, once in [**2153-6-30**], once in [**2154-7-31**], the first time from an adenomatous colonic polyp, the second time from a gastric arteriovenous malformation. 6.  Abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 6.8 cm currently, not been repaired 7.  Left eye blindness secondary to macular degeneration 8.  Carotid disease with a 90% right internal carotid artery stenosis, status post a left carotid endarterectomy 9.  Osteoarthritis 10. Peripheral neuropathy, likely secondary to alcohol use 11. History of peptic ulcer disease 12. Nephrolithiasis 13. Cholelithiasis  MEDICATIONS: 1.  Lopressor 50 mg twice a day 2.  Lasix 20 mg once daily 3.  Norvasc 10 mg once daily 4.  Aspirin 325 mg once daily 5.  Niferex 50 mg twice a day 6.  Epogen 3000 units every Wednesday  ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.  SOCIAL HISTORY:   He lives with his wife and daughter.  [**Name (NI) **] smoked three cigars a day for many years, but quit three months ago.  He drinks two beers and two glasses of brandy every night.  FAMILY HISTORY:   Noncontributory.  He has received his flu shot this year.  REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:   Positive for claudication for the past five to six years, that is unchanged.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   This is an elderly man, in no acute distress, who is febrile with a temperature of 101.4, tachycardic with a heart rate of 106.  His blood pressure is 164/71, and his respiratory rate is 28.  His oxygen saturation is 92% on room air, and improves to 94% on 2 liters nasal cannula.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination is unremarkable.  He has no jugular venous distention or lymphadenopathy.  His lungs have decreased breath sounds at the right base with dullness and no egophony.  His left lung is clear to auscultation.  His heart is regular, with no murmurs.  The abdomen is distended, which he says is a chronic finding.  It is nontender, with good bowel sounds.  He has no palpable hepatosplenomegaly, although he is quite distended.  He is guaiac negative.  His extremities are without edema and with 1+ distal pulses.  He has no calf tenderness.  He has no lower extremity asymmetry. His neurological examination is nonfocal, with intact cranial nerves, normal sensation, and 5/5 strength in all four extremities.  Chest x-ray reveals an unchanged right upper lobe opacity from his last chest x-ray, and a new right base opacity, question effusion vs. infiltrate.  His left lung is clear. There is no widening of the mediastinum.  Electrocardiogram reveals sinus tachycardia at 108.  He has a right bundle branch block and a left anterior fascicular block.  He has a right ventricular strain pattern with S1 Q3 T3 that is old.  His electrocardiogram is unchanged from his baseline electrocardiogram.  LABORATORY DATA:   He presented with a white count of 22.9, hematocrit of 30.2, and a platelet count of 514.  He also had a left shift with a differential that was 93% polys, 3% lymphs and 3% monos.  His coagulations were within normal limits.  His electrolytes were likewise within normal limits except for a BUN of 34, creatinine of 2.4, and glucose of 160.  His liver function tests were normal.  His amylase and lipase were normal as well.  His albumin was 4.  He ruled out for a myocardial infarction with negative CKs and troponins. His blood cultures were negative.  A cholesterol panel was checked, which revealed a cholesterol of 120, with an HDL of 42 and an LDL of 56.  His triglycerides were 109.  HOSPITAL COURSE:   Mr. [**Known lastname 3075**] was admitted with a recurrent right pneumonia and increased opacity of his right lung with question of effusion.  An ultrasound-guided tap was performed, which drained 1.5 liters of fluid.  He was changed to ceftriaxone and Flagyl, given his two previous courses of levofloxacin.  A chest CT was also obtained to evaluate his effusion, which was shown to be a loculated complicated one. His pleural fluid revealed an empyema that was growing alpha streptococcus.  On [**11-23**], he underwent thoracotomy with decortication for treatment of his empyema.  Cytology, cell block, intraoperative bronchoscopy and biopsies all were negative for malignancy.  Given that he was growing streptococcus, he was changed to penicillin-G for a two week course.  A PICC line was placed for access.  He was also ruled out for a myocardial infarction.  During his stay, he was continued on his Lopressor, Norvasc and aspirin.  His aspirin was held preoperatively and then restarted afterwards.  His creatinine increased from his baseline to 3.0 due to pre-renal azotemia.  He responded well to intravenous fluids, and his creatinine decreased to his baseline by the time of discharge.  He has iron-deficiency anemia secondary to gastrointestinal bleed.  His hematocrit remained stable during his hospitalization, but after his surgery, he was quite fatigued, and so he was transfused two units.  Postoperatively, his chest tubes were removed after they had minimal drainage with no evidence of air leak.  He suffered from delirium postoperatively, which was likely multifactorial, related to pain medication, anesthesia, infection, and distress from surgery.  It resolved slowly, with an improvement in his mental status to baseline. Low dose Haldol effectively treated his acute symptoms.  CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:   Improved.  DISCHARGE STATUS:  To [**Hospital 3058**] rehabilitation for strengthening postoperatively.  He will need to follow up with his pulmonologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2146**], in two to four weeks. He may need to follow up with Interventional Pulmonary for a repeat bronchoscopy in four to six weeks.  DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: 1.  Alpha streptococcal pneumonia with loculated empyema status post decortication 2.  Hypertension complicated by chronic renal insufficiency 3.  Diastolic dysfunction 4.  Iron-deficiency anemia from gastrointestinal bleed 5.  Abdominal aortic aneurysm 6.  Left eye blindness secondary to macular degeneration  DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1.  Lopressor 50 mg twice a day 2.  Lasix 20 mg once daily 3.  Norvasc 10 mg once daily 4.  Aspirin 325 mg once daily 5.  Niferex 50 mg twice a day 6.  Epogen 3000 units every Wednesday 7.  Penicillin-G 3 million units intravenously every four hours until [**2154-12-10**]                                 [**Name6 (MD) 251**] [**Name8 (MD) **], M.D.  [**MD Number(1) 910**]  Dictated By:[**Name8 (MD) 1552**] MEDQUIST36  D:  [**2154-11-28**]  23:55 T:  [**2154-11-29**]  00:28 JOB#:  [**Job Number 11731**] 1 1 1 R  \n"
