Date of Birth:   [**2083-12-28**]     Sex:  F

Service:  [**Doctor Last Name 1181**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 49 year old
woman with a history of end stage liver disease secondary to
hepatitis C complicated by esophageal varices as well as a
history of encephalopathy and prior spontaneous bacterial
peritonitis who was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] for
management of her ascites.  On that hospitalization multiple
attempts were made to manage her fluid overload with
diuretics, but she was ultimately refractory to them.  She
was referred for TIPS procedure for improved fluid
management.  The patient was readmitted on the day of
admission on [**4-7**] for TIPS.  The procedure was notable for
having somewhat difficult access, but no complications with
an estimated blood loss of 100 cc.  At the procedure she
received 4 mg of Versed, 600 of propofol, 150 of fentanyl.
She had been hemodynamically stable for several hours post
procedure, but then her blood pressure dropped from 100/40 to
70s to 80s over 30s and her heart rate remained sinus tach.
At the time, although her urine output remained strong, she
was transferred to the medical ICU for further management.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a prior machine operator on
disability.  She is not married.  She lives with her son.
She has a 15 pack year tobacco history, she quit in [**Month (only) 359**].
She has a history of alcohol use, particularly heavy in the
mid-[**2109**].  She has a history of IV drug abuse, none since
the [**2109**].

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.  It does not include liver
disease or bleeding disorder.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient's temperature was 98.5,
pulse 96, BP 95/48, respiratory rate 16, sating 98 percent on
3 liters.  In general, she was a pleasant, middle aged woman
lying in no acute distress.  Head and neck exams showed
normocephalic, atraumatic head with pupils equal, round, and
reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular movements
intact.  Oropharynx was slightly dry.  On neck exam she had a
right central venous line with mild ooze.  Heart was
tachycardiac with regular rhythm, no murmurs.  Lungs were
clear to auscultation bilaterally anteriorly.  Abdomen was
soft, nondistended, nontender with active bowel sounds.  She
had guaiac positive stool.  Extremities had 2+ edema to the
knees.  On neuro exam she was alert and oriented times three.
Cranial nerves II-XII were grossly intact.  Strength and
sensation were grossly intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 3.7, hematocrit 26.8, platelets
43.  PTT 39.5, INR 1.5.  Sodium 126, potassium 4.4, chloride
94, bicarb 26, BUN 31, creatinine 1.2, glucose 136.  Calcium
7.5, mag 1.2, phos 3.7.  AST 174, ALT 80, alka phos 126,
t-bili 3.1, LDH 255.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Hypotension.  The patient was admitted to the MICU for
hypotension.  The underlying etiology was not initially
clear, although the differential included excess anesthesia
from the procedure, particularly given her liver disease
versus hypovolemia from a hemorrhage, either around the liver
into the abdomen or within the GI tract versus sepsis.  She
was started empirically on antibiotics with levo and Flagyl.
She had an abdominal ultrasound to evaluate for ascites for
possible paracentesis.  There was no ascites.  She was
maintained on antibiotic prophylaxis for several days.  She
was transfused one unit of packed cells and given fluids to
improve her blood pressure and it responded appropriately.
She was started on Neo-Synephrine to keep her MAPS greater
than 55.  It took several days, but this was ultimately
weaned.  The entire time she had excellent urine output.  As
cultures continued to be negative and the patient had no
fever or white count, she was not maintained SBP antibiotic
coverage and once she was maintained on pressors, she was
able to be transferred out to the floor.  She had no further
evidence of hypotension while on the medicine floor.

2.  Hypoxia/congestive heart failure.  The patient was given
vigorous IV fluids hydration and blood during her MICU stay.
She subsequently became progressively hypoxic with diffuse
wheezing and a chest film that was consistent with fluid
overload.  She was started with diuresis once she was on the
medicine floor with rapid improvement in her hypoxia and her
lung exam.  Once the pulmonary edema was improved, her
exercise tolerance improved dramatically.

3.  Pulmonary.  The patient does have a history of asthma and
she was wheezing significantly when she hit the floor.  She
responded well to IV Lasix and frequent nebulizer treatments.
These will be continued as an outpatient per her
prehospitalization regimen.

4.  Status post TIPS.  The patient did not have any evidence
of encephalopathy and her abdominal distention improved
significantly over the course of her admission.  She was
between 2 and 3 liters negative per day and did not have an
untoward effects with respect to her renal failure.

5.  Renal.  The patient's creatinine slightly increased on
admission to the ICU.  However, over the course of her
admission, her creatinine went down to 1.0 by discharge which
is as good, if not better, than her typical baseline.

6.  Infectious disease.  When the patient was out on the
floor, she did not show any evidence of infection.  She was
continued on SBP prophylaxis regimen of Levaquin q.day.

7.  Endocrine.  The patient was continued on her diabetes
regimen with glargine and a sliding scale.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home with VNA for home safety
evaluation.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  End stage liver disease.
2.  Hepatitis C.
3.  Anasarca.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Flovent two puffs b.i.d.
2.  Albuterol one to two puffs q.six hours p.r.n.
3.  Serevent one puff b.i.d.
4.  Synthroid 100 mcg q.d.
5.  Protonix 40 mg q.d.
6.  Levaquin 250 mg q.d.
7.  Lactulose 30 ml p.o. t.i.d.
8.  Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
9.  Reglan 10 mg p.o. q.i.d.
10. Aldactone 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 49F ESLD [**3-2**] HCV, s/p TIPS for refractory ascites, admitted
for rising TBili who subsequently developed respiratory failure
and was transfered to the MICU.

1. Sepsis: upon initial admission to the ICU the patient was
started on a 10 day, broad spectrum course of antibx
prophylactically given an episode of hypotension. The patient
completed this course of antibx. However on HD 17 the patient
became hypotensive with elevated wbc, and lactic acidosis to 15.
 She was reinitiated on broad spectrum antibx and pressors. She
was initally started on levophed but her BP's continued to
decrease and was then started on neosynephrine.  Given the
patient's critically ill state at this time, the patient family
was called.  The family decided to withdraw support and the
patient passed away peacefully several hours later.

2. Respiratory Failure: likely secondary to a pleural effusion
which was tapped. Pleural fluid analysis was consistent w/ a
transudate likely from ascites/liver failure.  Over the course
of several weeks the patient's respiratory status improved and
was successfully extubated on HD 15.  However, the patient was
reintubated on HD 17 after she developed sepsis from which she
died on HD 18.

3.  ESLD: Acute on chronic liver failure. Liver (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] and
Transplant were following. Given the patient's critically ill
state, she was not amenable to transplant during her hospital
course. Lactulose was continued for hepatic encephalopathy.

4) Coagulopathy/Thrombocytopenia - secondary to ESLD. The pt was
transfused FFP, cryroprecipitate, platelets, and pRBCs PRN.

5) ARF: Hepatorenal syndrome versus ATN (granular casts in
urine). UOP was poor. Renal was consulted and the patient was
initiated on CVVHD.

6) DM2: Insulin GTT.

7) Asthma: Cont nebs PRN.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 56-year-old
male smoker with diabetes, and hypertension, and hepatitis C,
and status post anterior myocardial infarction who presented
with anterior myocardial infarction.

At midnight on the day prior to admission, the patient
experienced substernal chest pain while sitting at rest in
his bed.  The pain was radiating to his arms.  It was
described as not pleuritic.  It was associated with shortness
of breath.  The patient took sublingual nitroglycerin without
relief.  The pain lasted 10 minutes until Emergency Medical
Service arrived.  He was found to be hypertensive at 210/100.

The patient was brought to [**Hospital1 188**] Emergency Department.  Electrocardiogram showed sinus
rhythm at 54, normal axis, and normal intervals.  ST
elevations were noted to be 1 mm to 2 mm in leads V2 through
V5 and aVL.  Reciprocal ST depressions of 2 mm were seen in
leads II, III, and aVF.  The patient's electrocardiogram also
showed poor R wave progression.

The patient was taken to the Catheterization Laboratory.  He
was randomized to cool myocardial infarction protocol.  On
catheterization, the patient was found to have left main
coronary artery without flow-limiting lesions.  A 50% mid
distal lesion was seen in the left anterior descending artery
along with an occluded first diagonal that was stented.  The
left circumflex, right coronary artery, and ramus intermedius
were found to be normal.  Pulmonary artery saturation was
75%.  Pulmonary artery pressure was 27/11.  Per the protocol,
the patient was cooled to 33 degrees for five hours.  He was
started on aspirin, Integrilin, and Plavix and received a
heparin bolus.  He was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit for
monitoring.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:

history.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Physical examination
on admission revealed heart rate was 48, blood pressure
was 123/55, saturating 99% on room air.  The patient was
found to have dry mucous membranes.  No jugular venous
distention.  A regular rhythm.  Normal first heart sound and
second heart sound.  No murmurs.  The lungs were clear.  No
hematomas in the groin.  Extremities had bounding dorsalis
pedis pulses.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Complete blood
count and Chemistry-7 were within normal limits as were
coagulations.  Creatine kinase was 193.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:  The patient was started on
aspirin, and Plavix (for a 30-day course), and Integrilin
drip (for 18 hours).  The team did not start the patient on a
statin as he has a history of hepatitis C.

Liver function tests were normal with an AST of 36, ALT
was 118, alkaline phosphatase was 96, total bilirubin
was 0.5.

A cholesterol panel was as follows:  Total cholesterol
was 181, low-density lipoprotein was 102, high-density
lipoprotein was 30, triglycerides were 231.

An echocardiogram was done and revealed an ejection fraction
to be normal at 55%.  There was mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.  There was
mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
focal hypokinesis of the apex.  Also of note, mild aortic
sclerosis.

A beta blocker and ACE inhibitor were titrated to blood
pressure and heart rate control.  A hemoglobin A1c was found
to be 5.4.  Therefore, the patient was determined not to be a
diabetic.

nonfocal exam.  Respiratory:  Clear to auscultation with a
sucking chest wound.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and
rhythm.  Sternum with surrounding erythema of about 10 cm,
with a positive click.  Small draining hole in midincision
with milky serous drainage.  Staples remain in place.
Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended with normoactive
bowel sounds.  Extremities are warm and well-perfused with no
edema.  Right calf with a healing wound and minimal erythema.
Left knee with an endoscopic site that is healing, open to
air, clean and dry.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.  He was begun on
vancomycin 1 gm q 12 h, as well as levofloxacin 500 mg once
daily.  He was typed and screened and kept NPO for
mediastinal exploration plus/minus a flap closure.

On hospital day 2, the patient was brought to the operating
room.  Please see the OR report for full details.  In
summary, the patient had a sternal exploration and
debridement.  He tolerated the operation well and was
returned to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit intubated
and sedated with an open chest wound.  Plastic surgery was
also following the patient.

The patient did well in the immediate postoperative period.
His anesthesia was reversed.  He was weaned from the
ventilator and successfully extubated.  Several hours
following extubation, the patient was found to be in acute
respiratory distress and was emergently reintubated.  From
that point forward, he was kept sedated and ventilated
awaiting plastics follow-up for flap closure.

On the [**11-19**], the patient returned to the operating
room.  Please see the OR report for full details.  In
summary, the patient was brought to the operating room by the
plastic surgery service for pectoral advancement with an
omentum flap.  He tolerated the operation well and was
returned to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.  The
patient remained intubated following his surgery.  However,
his sedation was minimized to allow the patient to
overbreathe the ventilator.  During that period, the patient
had several episodes of coughing which led to a dehiscence of
his abdominal incision, and on the [**11-20**] the patient
again returned to the operating room for re-exploration and
closure of the fascia of his abdominal wound.  He tolerated
this surgery well also and following that returned to the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit, again ventilated and
sedated.  The patient remained ventilated and sedated for the
next several days in an attempt to give the wound a chance to
heal.

Ultimately, the patient was successfully extubated on the [**11-24**].  However, he stayed in the Cardiothoracic
Intensive Care Unit following extubation for close pulmonary
monitoring.  It should be noted that during the patient's ICU
course, he had several intermittent episodes of atrial
fibrillation for which he was begun on amiodarone, as well as
heparin and ultimately Coumadin for anticoagulation.  The
patient did well over the next several days, and ultimately
was transferred to the floor on [**11-28**], hospital day 15,
postoperative day 13.  At that point, a PICC line was placed
for long-term antibiotic coverage.

Over the next several days, the patient's activity level was
increased with the assistance of the nursing and the physical
therapy staff.  His antibiotic coverage was continued.  His
anticoagulation was transitioned from intravenous to oral.
Finally, on the [**12-1**], the patient's final [**Location (un) 1661**]-
[**Location (un) 1662**] drain was removed from his chest, and it was decided
that he was stable and ready to be transferred to
rehabilitation for long-term antibiotic coverage, as well as
glucose control.

At that time, the patient's physical exam was as follows:
Vital signs:  Temperature 98.4, heart rate 82--sinus rhythm,
blood pressure 113/66, respiratory rate 18, O2 sat 95 percent
on room air, weight day of dictation 106.6 kg, preoperatively
100 kg.  Lab data:  PT 17.1, INR 1.9, sodium 139, potassium
3.7, chloride 100, bicarb 27, BUN 11, creatinine 0.9, glucose
149, white count 9.1, hematocrit 28.4, platelets 830.
Physical exam - Neurologically:  Alert and oriented x 3,
nonfocal exam.  Pulmonary:  Clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Cardiac:  Regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2.
Sternum:  Incision with staples, clean and dry.  No erythema
or drainage.  Abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended with
normoactive bowel sounds.  Abdominal incision with staples,
also clean and dry.  Extremities were warm with no edema.
Right saphenous vein graft harvest site was healing well,
open to air, clean and dry.

stridor.  He has been on chronic steroid use since [**75**]/[**2173**].
His cardiovascular system:  Regular, rate, and rhythm, no
murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Abdomen is obese.  He has very
full neck and chin secondary to chronic steroid use.  His
motor strength is decreased throughout.  The patient has been
walking with a walker since [**2173**].  He had worsening
myelopathy.

He is admitted status post T4-T8 laminectomy without
intraoperative complications.  Postoperatively, his vital
signs are stable.  He was afebrile.  He was following
commands x4, moving all extremities with 4 plus strength.
His lungs were clear.  His abdomen was soft and nontender.
His EOMs were full.  Grasp was three.  His AT, [**Last Name (un) 938**], and
gastrocs were [**4-25**] bilaterally.  His dressing was clean, dry,
and intact.

On postoperative day number one, he was awake, alert, and
oriented times three.  His strength on the right IP is 5, 4
plus on the left.  Quads 4 plus on the right and 5 on the
left.  AT 5 on the right and 4 plus on the left.  Gastrocs 4

[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4125**]ospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2147-4-5**] for surgical
management of her aortic valve disease. She was taken to the
operating room where she underwent an aortic valve replacement
utilizing a 21mm pericardial valve. Postoperatively she was
taken to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit. On
postoperative day one, she awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated. She was then transferred to the cardiac surgical step
down unit for further recovery. Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was gently diuresed
towards her preoperative weight. The physical therapy service
was consulted for assistance with her postoperative strength and
mobility. Her pacing wires and drains were removed per protocol
without incident. On postoperative day five, Mrs. [**Known lastname **] had a
fever spike. She was pan cultured and empirically started on
ciprofloxacin.Her urine culture was positive for E.Coli and
ciprofloxacin was continued. She complained of numbness of her
right lateral thigh which improved slowly. It was presumed that
this was related to a right lateral femoral cutaneous nerve
neuropathy likely from positioning. Mrs [**Known lastname **] continued to make
steady progress and was discharged home on postoperative day
six. She will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **], her cardiologist
and her primary care physician as an outpatient.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 66-year-old female
with a past medical history of coronary artery disease,
status post CABG, ischemic cardiomyopathy with an EF of 20%,
status post left parietal CVA, and bilateral carotid aortic
stenosis, status post left CEA, who was transferred from an
outside hospital for right carotid artery stenting.

At the outside hospital, the patient was treated for CHF
exacerbation with successful diuresis.  Her hospital course
at that time was complicated by nausea, vomiting, with
elevated alkaline phosphatase and GGT status post right upper
quadrant ultrasound without evidence of stones or ductal
dilatation with trace ascites.  GI was consulted with
assessment of CHF versus possible gastritis.

A second complication included right MTP ulcers, status post
debridement.  No evidence of osteomyelitis.  This was treated
with Keflex for a ten day course.

The next issue included acute on chronic renal failure with
creatinine peak at 2.8, BUN 71.  Renal consult for this felt
that it was believed to be due to worsened CHF.

On presentation, the patient reported minimal shortness of
breath with significant fatigue and weakness.  She denied
chest pain, abdominal pain, orthopnea, PND, or fever and
chills.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Pertinent for chronic nausea for weeks
with intermittent vomiting.

day, quit a month ago.  Denied ethanol or illicit drug use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
98.0, BP 142/56, heart rate 50, respiratory rate 22, SP02 93%
on 2 liters.  General:  The patient was in no acute distress,
a pleasant female who appeared chronically ill.  HEENT:
Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Surgical left pupil.  Extraocular
movements intact.  Moist mucous membranes.  Clear oropharynx.
Neck:  Supple, no lymphadenopathy, positive JVP.  Pulmonary:
Decreased breath sounds one-fourth of the way up on the
right.  No wheeze.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm
with S3 and a II/VI systolic murmur at the left lower sternal
border.  Abdomen:  Soft, obese, bowel sounds positive,
positive hepatomegaly.  Extremities:  No edema.  The right
MTP revealed a shallow-based ulcer, 1+ DP pulses on the
right.  The left MTP showed a healing ulcer, 1+ DP pulses on
the left.  Neurological:  The patient was awake, alert, and
oriented.  Cranial nerves II through XII were intact.  The
patient was noted to be diffusely weak, right upper extremity
[**5-12**], deltoid, biceps, triceps, sensation diminished to light
and pinprick, stocking glove distribution.

ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA/STUDIES:  The EKG showed sinus
bradycardia at 52 beats per minute with leftward axis.  There
were T wave inversions in the anterolateral leads and [**Street Address(2) 4793**]
depression also in the anterolateral leads which were
unchanged from [**2142-3-21**].

The admission laboratories were pertinent for a hematocrit of
32.4.  Sodium 140, potassium 3.6, chloride 87, bicarbonate
40, BUN 60, creatinine 2.6, glucose 69.

Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly and mild failure.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Cardiology
Service and ruled out for a myocardial infarction.  She
continued diuresis until her baseline weight.  The day after
admission, the patient underwent stenting and PTA of the
right ICA with good results.

Post procedure, the patient had a hematocrit drop and was
given 1 unit of packed red blood cells to return to greater
than 30.  Also, postoperatively, the patient had episodes of
bradycardia to the 40s.  This was due to the procedure being
near the carotid body.  She was asymptomatic when this rate
drops.  Also of note, the patient's creatinine increased to
3.4.

The patient appeared intravascularly depleted and she was
given IV fluid hydration.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Right internal carotid artery stenosis, status post
stent.
2.  Chronic renal failure.

DISPOSITION:  The patient was discharged to home with VNA
Services.  Of note, the patient refused rehabilitation.

Date of Birth:   [**2127-2-27**]       Sex:  F

Service:  Cardiac surgery

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 39-year-old woman with
diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and obesity, with a
one to two months of chest burning with exertion. For the
past six months, she has been participating in a new vigorous
exercise program to lose weight. Her symptoms do gradually
resolve with rest, but they have started to occur now with
walking. She does acknowledge that there is associated
nausea, diaphoresis and shortness of breath. Now recently she
started to get symptoms for the past two days while at rest.
She was referred for an outpatient exercise tolerance test,
where she had chest pain and significant EKG changes. She was
referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization today, which
revealed significant left main artery disease. Just prior to
her transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], she did complain of chest pain and
back pain at about 7/10 intensity and a nitroglycerin drip
was started and she received 5 mg of IV Lopressor and 2 mg of
IV Ativan, which did resolve her pain. While she was in the
cath lab, she had an intraaortic balloon pump placed, and now
she is not actively complaining of any pain.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She denies any orthopnea, lower extremity
edema, but she does acknowledge that she does have
dysmenorrhea.

PRIOR MEDICAL HISTORY:  She has diabetes mellitus, type 2,
diagnosed in [**2157**]. She has been able to control it with diet
since [**2166-6-22**]; hypertension and obesity; however, she has
lost 40 pounds in the last six months.

SHE HAS AN ALLERGY TO SHELLFISH.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFERS TO [**Hospital1 18**]:  Atenolol 50 mg a day,
lisinopril 10 mg a day, Lipitor 20 mg a day, aspirin 325 mg
once a day, progesterone, nitroglycerin drip, Lopressor,
Ativan.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She does not smoke. She does not use ethanol
and she does not use cocaine. Her father had a brain tumor.
Her brother did have coronary artery disease and a myocardial
infarction in his late 30s. Her mother has hypertension. She
does have a strong family history for hyperlipidemia.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is comfortable appearing,
in no apparent distress. Vital signs: Temperature 99.1, pulse
72, blood pressure 144/87. Pulse oximetry is 98% on room air.
Head and neck: PERRLA. EOMI. Anicteric. Mucous membranes
moist. Neck supple, no lymphadenopathy, no JVD. Cardiac:
Regular rate and rhythm. Lungs clear to auscultation
bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended, but
she is morbidly obese, positive bowel sounds. Her extremities
are warm, no edema. She has got 5/5 strength in all
extremities.

Her laboratories prior to admission from [**Hospital3 1280**] were
white count 7.4, hematocrit of 39.8, platelets 190,000.
Hemoglobin A1c was 7.1. Sodium was 140, potassium 4.1,
chloride 103, bicarbonate 28, BUN 14, creatinine 0.6. Total
cholesterol was 307, triglycerides were 79, and HDL was 50.

[**Last Name (STitle) 54218**], which was at [**Hospital3 1280**] (it was not at
[**Hospital1 18**]), showed diffuse left main and proximal left anterior
descending artery stenosis, 60% to 70%, which was ulcerative;
50% mid LAD stenosis; 50% left circumflex stenosis after OM1;
moderate right coronary artery stenosis; a normal ejection
fraction of 78%; no mitral regurgitation. Note that the right
coronary artery stenosis that I am reported is different than
what was actually reported on the initial catheterization
results from [**Hospital3 1280**]. This was discussed between Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) 411**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**], and was not actually considered to be
80% as previously reported.

So this was a woman who was considered to have unstable
angina but not actively ischemic. She was put on an
intraaortic balloon pump, followed in the cardiac care unit,
and was ""preoped"" and consented for a CABG on the next day
because of her three-vessel disease. She was made n.p.o.
after midnight and then in the morning she was taken to the
operating room.

On[**Last Name (STitle) 19203**] of [**2167-1-9**], Ms. [**Known lastname 42915**] went to the
operating room with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for bypass surgery.
Please refer to the previously dictated operative note by Dr.
[**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for the specifics of this surgery. In brief,
three grafts were made. One was a left internal mammary to
the left anterior descending artery and then two saphenous
vein grafts were connected to the OM1 and OM2. She was on
cardiopulmonary bypass for 76 minutes and the aorta was cross
clamped for 53 of those minutes.

She tolerated the surgery well and was transferred to the
intensive care unit on propofol and Neo-Synephrine drips.

Postoperatively, Ms. [**Known lastname 42915**] did extremely well. Her
intraaortic balloon pump and all of her intravenous drips
were discontinued on postoperative day one. On postoperative
day two she was extubated and on postoperative day three she
was transferred to the floor. Ms. [**Known lastname 54219**] major floor issues
were as follows.

Ms. [**Known lastname 42915**] was followed by physical therapy, which cleared
her to go home with home physical therapy to assist with
mobility, strength and endurance. She was also actively
diuresed with Lasix and had her potassium repleted
accordingly. Finally, she was noted to have hyperglycemia
while she resumed her regular diet. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 8392**] consultation
was obtained and they recommended metformin 500 mg twice a
day to maintain euglycemia. She would follow her sugar as an
outpatient and report this back in an outpatient followup
appointment.

On [**1-14**] the patient's central line was discontinued.
She was scheduled to leave, but she developed chest pain;
however, this chest pain was considered not to be cardiac, to
be more gastrointestinal in nature, and she had ......... and
an EKG, both of which confirmed a noncardiac source for this
chest pain.

She is, therefore, on [**1-15**], postoperative day six,
being discharged home in good condition with home physical
therapy scheduled.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:
1.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Obesity.
4.  Hyperlipidemia.
5.  Unstable angina.
6.  Three-vessel coronary artery disease, status post
coronary artery bypass grafting, status post intraaortic
balloon pump.
7.  Hypokalemia.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Metoprolol 100 mg t.i.d.
2.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Captopril 50 mg p.o. t.i.d.
4.  Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. for one week.
6.  Potassium chloride 10 mEq p.o. b.i.d. for one week.
7.  Metformin 500 mg p.o. b.i.d.;  follow your blood sugar
levels and follow up with [**Doctor First Name 8392**].
8.  Percocet one to two tablets every four hours as needed
for pain.
9.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. as needed for constipation.

for concern or patient morbidity in the future, this lesion
can certainly be addressed percutaneously with balloon
angiography. She will be followed very closely by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 677**]
as an outpatient, and if this lesion does cause her problems,
this may be addressed.

Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65 year old female
with a 20 year history of hypertension and a ten year history
of Type 2 diabetes who demonstrated a positive exercise
stress test in [**2183-3-1**] suggestive for possible coronary
artery disease.  The patient received a stress test as part
of a risk stratification workup and at no point demonstrated
any evidence of chest pain.  A subsequent exercise MIBI study
performed [**2183-3-28**] revealed an exercise capacity of
only 2 minutes 15 seconds on the [**Doctor First Name **] protocol.  There was
no chest pain noted on the test and the peak exercise
electrocardiogram showed 1.5 to 2 mm horizontal to upsloping
ST depression in the inferior leads and in V1 and V2.
Imaging studies revealed a large apical to a small anterior
defect that was reversible.  The patient's ejection fraction
was noted to be 56% with normal wall motion.  The patient
subsequently underwent a cardiac catheterization on [**2183-4-22**] which demonstrated three vessel coronary artery disease
and mild diastolic ventricular dysfunction.  The patient was
thereafter referred to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1537**] for surgical
evaluation and was subsequently scheduled for a coronary
artery bypass graft on [**2183-4-28**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2183-4-28**], the patient underwent a
coronary artery bypass graft times three with grafts from the
left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending,
saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery and
saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal.  The patient
tolerated the procedure well.  The patient's pericardium was
left open.  Lines were placed including an arterial line and
a Swan-Ganz catheter ; both atrial and ventricular wires were
placed; tubes placed included in a mediastinal and bilateral
pleural tubes.  The patient was subsequently transferred to
the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit, intubated, for further
evaluation and management.  Shortly after arriving in the
Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit, the patient was easily weaned
and extubated without complication.  On postoperative day #1,
the patient was noted to be stable for transfer to the floor
and was subsequently admitted to the Cardiothoracic Service
under the direction of Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1537**].  The patient's
postoperative course was uneventful and she progressed well
clinically.  On postoperative day #1, the patient's chest
tube and Foley catheter were successfully removed without
complications.  Follow up chest x-ray demonstrated no
evidence of pneumothorax, and the patient was noted to be
independently productive of adequate amounts of urine for the
duration of her stay.  Physical therapy performed an initial
evaluation with the patient and followed her progress for the
duration of her stay.  On postoperative day #3, the patient's
pacer wires were removed without complications and her
sternal incision was noted to be clean, dry and intact with
Steri-Strips in place.  The patient was successfully advanced
to a regular diet, which she tolerated well and was noted to
have adequate pain control via oral pain medications.  The
patient steadily advanced in her ability to ambulate freely
and was subsequently cleared for discharge to home by
physical therapy.  The patient was subsequently cleared for
discharge to home on postoperative day #4, [**2183-5-3**], with
instructions for follow up.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient is to be discharged to
home with instructions for follow up.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Stable.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.12 hours times ten days
2.  Potassium chloride 20 mEq p.o. q. 12 hours times ten days
3.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.

COMMENTS:
1. Right heart catheterization revealed elevated right and left
sided
pressures. (PCWP = 25 mmhg).
2. Left heart catheterization revealed no evidence of systolic
hypertension.  Calculated cardiac output and index were 5.0/2.8.

3. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
three vessel coronary artery disease.  The left main coronary
artery had
a 40% mid-vessel stenosis.  The left anterior descending artery
had
diffuse proximal disease with serial 70-80% stenosis.  The left
anterior
descending had mild diffuse disease in the mid and distal
segments.  The
large first diagonal had an 80% proximal lesion.  The left
circumflex
coronary artery had mild diffuse disease in the proximal, mid,
and
distal segments.  There was a subtotal occlusion of the OM1.
The right
coronary artery was the dominant vessel.  There was total
occlusion of
the right coronary artery in the proximal segment.  The distal
RCA
filled via collaterals from the LCA septal branches.
4. No left ventriculography was undertaken given elevated Cr.
5. Successful predilation using 2.0 X 12 sprinter balloon and
stenting
using a minivision 2.5 X 23 stent of the proximal OM1 with
lesion
reduction from 99 to 0%
6. Successful predilaton using a 2.0 X 20 Maverick balloon and
stenting
using 3.0 X 30 Driver stent of the proximal LAD with lesion
reduction
from 80% to 0%.
7. Successful predilation using 2.0 X 12 sprinter balloon and
stenting
using a 2.25 X 15 minivision stent of the proximal D1 with
lesion
reduction from 80% to 0%. The final angiogram showed TIMI III
flow in
the vessels intervened with no residual stenoses in any of the
stents.
Thre was no distal embolisation or dissection noted in any
vessel.
8. Successful insertion of IABP via right femoral artery.
( see PTCA comments for the above procdures from 5 through to 8)

9. At the request of the renal consultants, a 12 French Dialysis
central
venous catheter was placed using the Seldinger technique in the
left
common femoral vein.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Elevated right and left sided pressures.
3. Preserved cardiac output/cardiac index.
4. Successful stenting of the OM, LAD and D1.
5. Successful insertion of IABP via right femoral artery.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Rhythm: pt had 2 episodes of monomorphic VT accompanied by
fall in BP, LOC, terminated x 1 via precordial thumb.
Electrolytes were repeleted, pt was bolused with Amiodarone x 2,
and started on an Amio gtt. Amiodarone was then changed to po,
with a dosing schedule of 400 mg [**Hospital1 **] for one week, followed by
400 mg daily for one week, then 200 mg per day.  Monomorphic VT
thought to be likely due to a fixed area of scarring from
previous MI.  Placement of an ICD was discussed.  However, given
the pt's poor prognosis for non sudden cardiac death reasons,
and given his increased infectious risk, it was decided to treat
his arrhythmia medically.  Of note, the QT interval was
prolonged (506), likely secondary to amiodarone.  Patient
remained in sinus rhythm on Amiodarone.
2. CAD: Pt with NSTEMI. Cath on [**9-12**] showed 3 vessel disease,
subsequently underwent successful stenting of OM, D1, LAD and
IABP placement. IABP was discontinued after the patient was able
to maintain his own pressure.
Echo completed on [**9-13**], which showed apical akinesis, with
severely depressed systolic function.  Patient was initially
started on heparin and bridged to Coumadin, however, he had
another episode of guaiac positive stool, and given his history
of melena and coffee ground emesis, the risk for GI bleed was
thought to be high and anticoagulation was discontinued.
The patient was continued on an aspirin, Statin, beta blocker,
and was started on an ACE, all of which he will continue as an
outpatient.  His swan and sheath were discontinued without
complications.
3.PUMP: CHF: EF 20% by ECHO
He was initially placed on Imdur/Hydral for afterload reduction
and an ACE was initially avoided in an attempt to salvage his
kidneys.  However, he was eventually started on low-dose
lisinopril to be titrated up if necessary.  Patient also
underwent hemodialysis on Mon/Wed/Fri schedule.
4. Renal: Chronic renal disease, secondary to hypertensive
nephrosclerosis, is status post graft placement with mature A-V
graft. Quentin catheter initially used, then discontinued once
graft accessible.  On [**9-22**], graft noted to be difficult to
access per renal, patient underwent AV fistulogram, and
successful angioplasty was performed.
5. ID: Patient completed a seven day course of levofloxacin for
suspected pneumonia, white blood count noted to be persistently
elevated.  Patient was pan cultured, and a urine culture was
positive for yeast.  Foley catheter was discontinued and a
repeat culture was sent, also positive for [**Female First Name (un) **].  Patient
started on a 2 week course of Fluconazole.  Blood cultures
pending at time of discharge, no growth to date.
6. Heme: anemia, likely anemia of chronic disease from chronic
renal disease.  Patient also had an episode of melena and coffee
ground emesis, guaiac positive stool.  Hematocrit was followed,
and patient was transfused as necessary to keep hematocrit above
30.  Patient will need GI workup as an outpatient. Oral iron
supplementation was discontinued as patient receiving Fe in
addition to EPO and Procrit at hemodialysis
7. DM: Patient was started on glargine for persistent
hyperglycemia and covered with a regular insulin sliding scale
with Accu-Check to monitor.
8. Psych: Patient was continued on his home dose of Zoloft 100
mg once daily.
Patient tolerated a low Na/cardiac healthy diet and was placed
on a PPI for GI prophylaxis.
Patient was discharged to rehab facility with plan to follow up
with cardiology and PCP within the next month.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and plan:
87 yo M with MMP including DM, HTN, CAD, PVD on HD with L arm
fistula presents with septic shock.
.
1. Sepsis:
The pt was found to be hypotensive and febrile in the ED and
admitted through sepsis protocol. He was infused with muliple
boluses of normal saline, put on levophed for blood pressure
support. He was covered with broad spectrum antibiotic
empirically as culture data was sent. Blood cultures were found
to be positive for gram postive cocci which was ultimately shown
to be VRE. Vancomycin was changed to linezolid. The pt remained
hypotensive on pressors for the next several days and a work-up
was initiated to determine the source of infection. MRI of the
foot was pursued to r/o osteomyelitis, and a CT of the abdomen
was down to r/o an abdominal source of infection.
   The CT Abdomen and pelvis showed possible abscess in liver
and spleen. There was also pancolitis. GI and Surgery were
[**Year/Month/Day 4221**] for assistance in the management of these problems.
For the pancolitis, the pt was kept NPO and he was treated for
possible c. diff infection while c. diff cultures were sent and
found to be positive. A RUQ U/S [**2135-2-2**] was pursued which showed
evidence of hypoechoic lesion could be flegmon or mass. It was
unable to be confirmed on imaging whether these lesions on CT
which were new compared with a previous scan in [**10-1**] were
abscesses vs possible mets from an unknown primary. IR was
[**Date Range 4221**] for possible drainage or biopsy, however option
declined given localization of lesions and the pts significant
bleeding risk. The GI team suggested an MRI to further evaluate
the liver lesions although this was unable to be pursued because
the pt was too unstable requiring pressors for bp support. A TTE
Echo was done to r/o endocarditis or abscess and was negative.
Head CT was negative for abscess as well.
.
2. CMO:
On the morning of [**2135-2-6**], the ICU team discussed with Mr
[**Known lastname **] wife and daughter the different alternatives for Mr
[**Known lastname **] care. It was explained that the feeling of the medical
staff and nurse staff was that Mr [**Known lastname **] has been extremily
uncomfortable with all the procedures that he undergoes during
the day. Despite giving pain medicines he has shown signs of a
lot of discomfort. We explained to the family that we would need
a NGT place in order to feed him and give him some of his
medicines now that he is having trouble swallowing given his
mental status. Also we have explained that we still not have a
clear dx on his liver lesions, and in order to obtained a dx he
might need a surgical intervention for biopsy. It would be a
long road ahead before he is able to go back to where he was
previously.
Ms [**Known lastname **] feels that her husband would not want to have all this
procedures done along the road and that we should change the
focus of care towards making him as comfortable as possible.
    The antibiotics and pressors were d/c'ed. The plan was to
have no more dialysis. There were no more lab draws. A morphine
drip was started for pain. The pt remained arousable though
sleepy. His blood pressure was in the 80s-90s systolic off
pressors and his extremities continued to show evidence of
perfusion. On the evening of [**12-10**], he skin became more pale and
his sensorium less alert. At 2:08 am he was found to have ceased
respirations and was without a heart rate on the monitor. By
2:15 am he was pronounced deceased.
.
2. CAD: h/o MI.
Continued sinvastatin, aspirin until made CMO. BB and BP
medications were held in the setting of hypotension
.
3. Peripheral vascular disease: continued plavix, Aspirin until
CMO
The vascular team followed the pt.
.
4. DM: insulin sliding scale was continued before the pt was
made CMO.
.
#. ESRD: The pt continued to recieve periodic dialysis sessions
while in house until he was made CMO.
.
#. FEN:
He was kept NPO given the colitis and sepsis.
.
# Hypothyroidism: continued levothyroxine until CMO.
.
# PPX: Pantoprazole, pneumoboots until CMO.
.
#Code: DNR-DNI was changed to CMO on [**2-6**]
.

Brief Hospital Course:
She was taken to the operating room on [**2122-2-10**] where she
underwent an AVR (21 mm CE magna pericardial)/CABG x 2
(LIMA->LAD, SVG->PDA), MVR (25 mm [**Company **] mosaic porcine
mitral) and spetal myomectomy. She was transferred to the CSRU
in critical but stable condition paced with complete heart
block. She was extubated and weaned form her vasoactive drips
later that same day. She remained in complete heart block and
was seen by electrophysiology. On [**2-13**] she was reintubated and
had a [**Company 1543**] Sigma dual chamber pacemaker placed. She was
extubated on [**2-14**]. A HIT panel, which was sent for a platelet
count of 63, was negative. She went into aflutter  and was
started on amiodarone and heparin and coumadin. She was
transferred to the floor on POD #5. She converted to sinus
rhythm. Her amiodarone was decreased due to prolonged QTC. Her
activity was advanced with nursung and PT. She was ready for
discharge home on POD 10.

Date of Birth:   [**2114-9-17**]     Sex:  M

Service:  C-MED Gold

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 68-year-old
gentleman with a significant cardiac history with coronary
artery disease (status post coronary artery bypass graft),
hypertension, congestive heart failure, hyperlipidemia, and
diabetes mellitus who presented with worsening congestive
heart failure of several months in duration with new onset
chest pressure.

The patient was in his usual state of health until three days
prior to admission when he began to experience increasing
shortness of breath at rest and with exertion. However, the
patient was still able to walk his dog for approximately one
half of a mile per day.  No paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  No
orthopnea.  Minimal bilateral lower extremity edema at
baseline.

The patient had one episode of [**5-10**] chest pressure (his
anginal equivalent) with exertion three days prior to
admission which resolved after one hour.

On the day prior to admission, the patient had a second
episode of [**10-10**] chest pressure, substernal, and without
radiation.  No associated nausea, vomiting, or palpitations.
Mild diaphoresis and lightheadedness.  The patient took one
sublingual nitroglycerin, and his pain score went down to
7/10, and he presented to the [**Hospital1 188**] Emergency Department for evaluation.

In the [**Hospital1 **] Emergency Department, the
patient's chest pressure was relieved with aspirin, heparin,
nitroglycerin, and Integrilin.  He also received metoprolol
intravenously.  He did continue to be short of breath despite
receiving 80 mg of Lasix intravenously on arrival.

The initial electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with a
left bundle-branch block and left atrial abnormality, without
any significant changed when compared to the previous tracing
of [**2183-2-22**].  His initial creatine kinase was 326
with a troponin T of 0.31.

Of note, the patient denies fevers or chills.  He has a
slight cough with sputum.  He is not on a low diet.  No
recent dietary indiscretion.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease.

vein graft to diagonal.
(b)  Persantine MIBI on [**2183-2-4**] demonstrated a
dilated left ventricle, partially reversible moderate
perfusion defect in the anterior left ventricular wall, with
moderate fixed deficits at the septal/inferior walls, global
and left ventricular hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of
21%.
2.  Congestive heart failure; [**State 531**] Heart Association
class II.  An echocardiogram on [**2183-1-31**] with

FAMILY HISTORY:   Family history was noncontributory for
coronary artery disease.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a retired painter.  He has
been married times 44 years.  He has a 60-pack-year history
of tobacco; he quit 15 years ago.  Occasional alcohol use.
No intravenous drug use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on admission revealed his temperature was 98.4 degrees
Fahrenheit, blood pressure was 133/64, his heart rate was
107, his respiratory rate went from 40 to 24, and his oxygen
saturation was 95% on 2 liters.  In general, an elderly
gentleman in no apparent distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose,
and throat examination revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.
Pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation.   Extraocular movements were intact.  The neck
was supple.  No lymphadenopathy.  No thyromegaly.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate.  Normal
first heart sounds and second heart sounds.  No murmurs,
rubs, clicks, or gallops.  Pulmonary examination revealed
decreased breath sounds at the bases bilaterally.  No rales
or wheezes.  The abdomen was obese, soft, nontender, and
nondistended.  Normal active bowel sounds.  No
hepatosplenomegaly or masses.  Extremity examination revealed
2+ pitting edema bilaterally to the knees.  Neurologic
examination revealed alert and oriented times three.  Cranial
nerves II through XII were grossly intact.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Initial
laboratories revealed creatine kinase was 326, CK/MB was 14,
troponin T was 0.25, and MB index was 4.3.  His white blood
cell count was 7.8, his hematocrit was 33, and his platelets
were 281.  Sodium was 135, potassium was 4.2, chloride was
99, bicarbonate was 28, blood urea nitrogen was 24,
creatinine was 1.1, and blood glucose was 303.  Prothrombin
time was 13.8, partial thromboplastin time was 25.2, and his
INR was 1.3.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray demonstrated
cardiomegaly with pulmonary vasculature redistribution and a
new lingular opacity (pneumonia versus asymmetric pulmonary
edema), and a small calcified granuloma in the right upper
lobe (as previously demonstrated).

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  The
patient was admitted to the C-MED Service, placed on
telemetry, and continued on his outpatient cardiac
medications, as well as a nitroglycerin, heparin, and
Integrilin drips.

1.  CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE ISSUES:  At baseline, the
patient had been on 2 liters nasal cannula of home oxygen.
His oxygen requirement remained stable while in house on 3
liters nasal cannula.  He was saturating at 97%.

An echocardiogram was performed on [**2183-8-21**] which
demonstrated an ejection fraction of 20% with global
hypokinesis; consistent with prior examination.

The patient was continued on digoxin 0.25 mg by mouth once
per day and Lasix 80 mg intravenously once per day.  Daily
weights and strict ins-and-outs were monitored.  On the day
of discharge, the patient no longer had edema of the lower
extremities.  He was saturating at 100% on 2 liters with his
lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.

2.  CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient ruled in by
enzyme criteria; however, his electrocardiogram continued to
be unchanged with a left bundle-branch block at baseline.

There was consideration of catheterization during this
inpatient stay; however, given the patient's complications
with gastrointestinal bleeds, as well as his reluctance to
undergo this procedure, this was deferred.

The patient underwent a chemical stress MIBI on [**2183-8-26**]; during which time he had no anginal symptoms or
interpretable electrocardiogram changes.  By verbal report,
the nuclear portion of this study demonstrated fixed defects
in the anterior/inferior walls with an ejection fraction of
20% and left ventricular cavity enlargement.

3.  ANEMIA/GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED ISSUES:  The patient had an
episode of melena on the morning of [**2183-8-22**].  He
denied bright red blood per rectum, hematemesis,
coffee-grounds emesis, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain.
He had never had symptoms of gastrointestinal bleeding in the
past.

A nasogastric lavage demonstrated no active upper
gastrointestinal bleed, and his vital signs remained stable
with a stable hematocrit at 29.8.  Two large-bore intravenous
lines were placed, and the patient was transfused a total of
three units of packed red blood cells with 80 mg of
intravenous Lasix prior to this transfusion.  He was also
started on Protonix 40 mg intravenously twice per day.  The
Integrilin, heparin, and aspirin were held.

A Gastroenterology consultation was obtained, and an
esophagogastroduodenoscopy was recommended and performed on
the morning of [**2183-8-23**].  This demonstrated gastritis.
Nevertheless, due to the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding
he was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit because
of concern over the initial hematocrit drop from 33 to 26
with a question of potential retroperitoneal bleed.

On [**2183-8-22**], when he was transferred to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit, an abdominal and pelvic computed
tomography without contrast was obtained which demonstrated
some cholelithiasis without evidence for cholecystitis, and
no evidence of retroperitoneal bleed.

An anemia workup was continued, and iron studies demonstrated
an elevated ferritin and decreased total iron-binding
capacity suggesting likely anemia of chronic disease with
acute anemia secondary to gastritis superimposed.

The patient remained stable and was transferred back to the
C-MED Service on the evening of [**2183-8-23**].  For the
duration of his inpatient course, the patient's hematocrit
remained stable at 32.7, and he did not experience subsequent
episodes of melena or hematemesis.

Of note, the aspirin, heparin, and Integrilin continued to be
held (this contributed to the unwillingness to perform
cardiac catheterization during this inpatient stay).

4.  PNEUMONIA ISSUES:  On admission chest x-ray, the patient
was noted to have a lingular infiltrate that was felt to be
new compared to prior studies.  Of note, the patient's white
blood cell count was 7.8, but he did spike to 102.3 degrees
Fahrenheit on [**2183-8-22**].  Thus, it was felt that the
chest x-ray infiltrate was consistent with pneumonia, and he
was started on levofloxacin 500 mg once per day for a 10-day
course.

The patient's chest x-ray gradually improved during his
inpatient stay.  On the day of discharge, his temperature was
99.6 with a white blood cell count of 13.3.  Of note, his
maximum white blood cell count had been 13.9.  The patient
had been afebrile for 48 hours prior to discharge.

5.  DIABETES MELLITUS ISSUES:  The patient was placed on an
insulin sliding-scale with four times per day fingersticks.
His glucose remained within normal limits during this
hospital course.

6.  MENTAL STATUS CHANGE ISSUES:  The patient was minimally
agitated during his Medical Intensive Care Unit stay.  It was
felt that this was likely baseline dementia with superimposed
Intensive Care Unit delirium.  He did have a recent head
computed tomography which showed no acute event.

Of note, his mental status was much improved upon transfer to
the floor.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:   The patient was discharged on [**2183-8-26**].  His vital signs were stable.  He was saturating at
100% on 2 liters nasal cannula.  His creatine kinase levels
had been dropping from 187 to 108 with a troponin of 0.31.
He was asymptomatic.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Acute non-ST-segment myocardial infarction.
2.  Pneumonia.
3.  Coronary artery disease.
4.  Gastrointestinal bleed.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Lipitor 20 mg by mouth once per day.
2.  Celexa 20 mg by mouth by mouth twice per day.
3.  Doxazosin 2-mg tablets one tablet by mouth once per day.
4.  Timolol eyedrops 0.25% one both eyes q.a.m.
5.  Levofloxacin 500-mg tablets one tablet by mouth once per
day (for a 10-day course with day one being on [**2183-8-22**]).
6.  Lisinopril 40 mg by mouth once per day.
7.  Digoxin 250-mg tablets one tablet by mouth once per day.
8.  Carvedilol 12.5 mg by mouth twice per day.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**]
Chief Complaint:
Admit for carotid angiography and possible intervention.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
S/P stenting of left carotid artery


History of Present Illness:
64 year-old woman, patient of Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 122**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 487**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], with an extensive history of CAD,
now s/p recent left upper lobectomy for lung cancer with an
incidental finding of an old CVA on head CT postoperatively
prompting a workup that revealed 90% left internal carotid
stenosis on duplex, vs 55% on CTA of neck, now referred for left
carotid angiography to more clearly define her carotid anatomy,
and carotid intervention, if appropriate. Events were as
follows:
[**2128-9-28**] IMI - Treated with stenting of the RCA and LCx. Found
to have severe MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 12876**] and was referred for
surgical repair.
[**2128-10-27**] Mitral valve surgery aborted after TEE at time of
surgery revealed largely normal mitral valve with improvement of
inferior hypokinesis compared to month prior.
[**3-/2129**] Cardiac Catheterization - Total occlusion of RCA stent and
patent LCX stent, mild to mod MR
[**7-/2129**] Pulmonary edema requiring intubation at an OSH. Transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] and had a cardiac cath revealing T.O RCA and 40% CX
stenosis in prior stent. EF of 30%
[**2129**] AICD placement
[**2135-10-24**] Cath d/t worsening chronic angina and DOE and inferior
ischemia on dobutamine viability study. Angiography revealed 40%

LAD, 40% LCX ISRS, RCA totally occluded with distal filling via
left to right collaterals. S/P Unsuccesful recanalization of the
RCA. FFR of CX lesion demonstrated it to be a hemodynamically
insignificant lesion.
[**2136-2-2**] s/p VATS, left upper lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node
dissection d/t adenocarcinoma. Patient d/c'd on [**2-8**] and
readmitted on [**2-13**] d/t mental status changes and hypotension. A
chest CT was done which was negative for a PE. A CT of the head
was done revealing no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, but a
hypodensity at the right temporo-occipital junction. This could
represent a late subacute to chronic infarct vs metastatic
disease. A CT with contrast was done the following day revealing
the same findings. A carotid series was therefore ordered and
done on [**2136-2-15**]. This revealed an 80-99% stenosis of the left
internal carotid artery and a <40% stenosis of the right
internal carotid artery. A TTE was done on [**2136-2-15**]. This
revealed an ef of 40% with 1+MR, small to moderate sized
pericardial effusion. Mild symmetric LVH. Hypokinesis noted in
the infero-septum, inferior and infero-lateral walls. Akinesis
noted in the basal infero-septum and inferior wall.
.
The patient was subsequently referred to see Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 487**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
as an outpatient who has recommended her for carotid angiography
and intervention. The patient was then seen in clinic by Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of neurology who is in agreement that the head
CT scan abnormality is very likely an embolic stroke and feels
that left carotid intervention is appropriate. The patient was
also seen by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] of neurosurgery who felt that
it is exceedingly unlikely that the lesion on CT scan represents
a malignancy vs. metastasis and cleared her to undergo a carotid
procedure. He recommended repeat head CT in 3 months.
.
Follow up studies have included:
[**2136-2-23**] Chest XRAY: Normal post left upper lobectomy appearance.
No evidence of any cardiopulmonary process.
[**2136-3-8**] CTA of neck: approximately 55% left sided carotid
stenosis at the bifurcation
[**2136-3-20**] CT of brain with and without contrast: No change of
right posterior temporal-occipital region, likely represents a
chronic infarct. Noted to have tortuous basilar artery. Basilary
artery summit positioned to the left of the midline. Just
anterior to the summit is a 2-mm area of contrast
enhancement--Finding could represent very tortuous origin of
left posterior cerebral artery or contigious tiny aneurysm.
.
In terms of symptoms, the patient denies any neurological
deficits, confusion,or lightheadedness. She further denies any
chest pain. She does report having dyspnea after climbing one
flight of stairs.
.
On day of admission, she underwent carotid angiography with
stent placement

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 74 year-old woman with a history of CAD s/p
CABG in 10/84 with redo in 11/84, stent to left subclavian in
[**6-17**] and repeat dx cath without intervention in [**10-18**], EF of 35%
on echo in [**2145**], atrial fibrillation diagnosed in [**2146**] managed
with rate control and anti-coagulation, hypertension, lipids and
asthma/possible COPD (no PFT's noted in record/no smoking
history) admitted now with SOB/unstable angina.  The patient's
current symptomatology began last friday [**12-12**] when she
developed URI symptoms including nasal congestion and cough.
Since then she has noted increased dyspnea, increased episodes
of her anginal pain including at rest and cough productive of
yellow/celery colored sputum.  Dyspnea has increased to point
where she has trouble with stairs now where recently she has
not.  Has dry cough at baseline attributed to Mavik, but her
current cough is different.  Has also had significantly
increased fatigue over this time.  Takes combivent or albuterol
with some relief of shortness of breath.  Her SOB brought her to
see her PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1262**].  CXR was obtained and revealed no acute
process. Other history from that visit is unobtainable.
Last night she had palpitations and her shortness of breath
subsequently worsened which ultimately brought her to [**Hospital1 18**]
today.
Reports taking all her medications.  Has had some dietary
indiscretion recently including salted fish last friday and
dining out recnetly.
Also reports increased stress and exposure to dogs at family
members house.
Denies fever or chills.  Denies feeling dizzy, syncope. NO
weight loss. Appetite has been good.

Last cath:
PROCEDURE DATE: [**2147-11-15**]
INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION:
Chest pain. Prior CABG. S/P subclavian stent.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Native three vessel coronary artery disease with extensive
bridging
collaterals of the RCA.
2. Known occluded saphenous vein grafts.
3. Patent LIMA to LAD.
4. Patent left subclavian stent.
5. Mild mitral regurgitation.
6. Mild systolic ventricular dysfunction.
7. Mild right common-femoral vascular disease.
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary arteriography in this right dominant system showed
native
three-vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had mild luminal
irregularities. The LAD artery was occluded in the mid-vessel.
The left
circumflex artery was proximally occluded with two distal OMs
with a
""jump"" segment filling via left to left collaterals. The RCA was
proximally occluded with many bridging collaterals supplying the
distal
RCA and posterior LV branches.
2. Saphenous vein grafts were known to be occluded from a prior
catheterization dated [**6-17**] and were therefore not visualized.
3. Graft angiography showed a widely patent LIMA to LAD,
supplying the
distal [**1-18**] of the LAD and large collaterals to the RCA and
r-PDA.
4. Left subclavian angiography showed a widely patent left
subclavian
stent.
5. Resting hemodynamics showed normal left-sided filling
pressure.
6. Left ventriculography showed mild global hypokinesis with
more
pronounced hypokinesis of the inferior wall. There was trace
mitral
regurgitation. The calculated LVEF was 45%.
7. Limited left ilio-femoral peripheral angiography showed a
mild 30%
stenosis of the common femoral artery.

EKG: afib, left axis deviation, ST depression and TWI in V2-V6.

[**12-19**] Echo:

Study continues from Tape [**2149**] W487 to tape [**2149**] W 509, starting
at 0:15 for an additional seven minutes of recording.
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV cavity size. Suboptimal technical
quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Depressed LVEF. Cannot assess LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: RV not well seen.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+)
MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild [1+] TR. Mild PA systolic hypertension.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.

Conclusions
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. LV systolic function appears depressed. Overall
left ventricular systolic function cannot be reliably assessed.
3. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
4. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

[**12-26**] cath:
PROCEDURE DATE: [**2149-12-26**]
INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION:
EKG changes.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Patent LIMA-LAD
COMMENTS: 1. Selective coronary angiography of this right
dominant
system revealed three vessel disease. The LMCA was diffusely
disease.
The LAD was occluded mid-vessel and filled distally via the
LIMA. The
LCX was occluded proximally, and filled distally from
collaterals from
the LCX. The RCA was occluded proximally and filled distally via
bridging collaterals.
2. Graft angiography revealed a patent LIMA-LAD. The SVGs were
not
imaged as they were known to be occluded.
3. Left ventriculography was not performed.
4. The left subclavian stent was widely patent.

LIVER OR GALLBLADDER ULTRASOUND.

INDICATION: 74 year old female with abdominal pain, increased
LFTs. Evaluate
for gallstones, or liver disease.

There are no prior studies for comparison.

The patient is status post cholecystectomy. The common bile duct
measures 5
mm, and is within normal limits status post cholecystectomy. The
liver shows
no focal abnormalities. The liver parenchyma is mildly
hyperechoic in
echotexture, consistent with fatty infiltration. The right
kidney measures
8.3 cm. There is a mild hyperechoic focus within the interpolar
right kidney,
with no evidence of posterior shadowing, possibly representing a
small
parenchymal calcification Within the lateral aspect of the right
kidney, in
the interpolar region, there is a 1.2-cm anechoic focus, most
likely
representing a simple cyst. The left kidney measures 8.1 cm,
with no focal
abnormalities.

IMPRESSION:

1) Patient is status post cholecystectomy.

2) The liver is echogenic, consistent with fatty liver. However,
other forms
of liver disease, and more advanced liver disease, including
significant
hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this study.

[**12-24**] chest x-ray:
INDICATION: Shortness of breath, s/p extubation. Check status.

FINDINGS: A single AP semi-upright image. Comparison study dated
[**2149-12-21**]. The heart shows slight left ventricular enlargement. There
is evidence of
a prior CABG procedure. A vascular stent is noted in the left
brachiocephalic
vessel. The pulmonary vessels are normal. No pulmonary
infiltrates are seen.
There is slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle and
slight widening
of the minor fissure consistent with a small effusion. The hila
and
mediastinum are otherwise unremarkable. The ETT and the NG line
remain well
positioned.

IMPRESSION: Possible small right pleural effusion. No other
acute
cardiopulmonary abnormality. Prior CABG surgery noted and prior
left
brachiocephalic stent in place.



Brief Hospital Course:
72 year-old woman with CAD s/p CABG in [**2129**], stent to left
subclavian in [**6-17**], re-cath in 02 as above, history of CHF,
depressed EF,  hypertension, afib astham/COPD who presents now
with increasing SOB and anginal episodes after URI last Friday.

Cardiovascular:
a)ischemia: Concerning past history, very high risk and now with
good story for unstable angina [**Female First Name (un) **] admit. Patient was ruled out
for MI on admission.  After stabilization of her pulmonary
issues, given her history and an echo which could not fully
assess LVEF and could not rule out RWMA, she went for cardiac
catherterization and found to have no new lesions, patent LIMA
to LAD.
Patient maintained on ACE, beta-blocker, statin, aspirin, imdur.
Imdur and beta-blocker titrated up.  D/ced calcium channel
blocker with likely systolic dysfunction and definite diastolic
CHF. Sublingual nitro as needed.  Had been on Mavik for unclear
reason, tolerating ACE here--would titrate up for heart failure
as below.
Continues to have seom angina with stress.

b)pump: Patient noted to have depressed EF in past-35%? but no
recent echo on admission.   Echo here showed: 1. The left atrium
is mildly dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. LV systolic function appears depressed. Overall
left ventricular systolic function cannot be reliably assessed.
3. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
4. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. On
admission, the patient was felt to be euvolemic to slightly
volume overloaded and gently diuresed but her SOB was primarily
due to astham/copd exacerbation. AFter transfer to ICU(see
below) patient received lots of fluids and needed to be
diuresed.  Diuresed adequately for discharge--felt to be dry for
discharge by exam and labs. Given that she was acutely
decompensated from pulmonary perspective and volume overloaded
when echo was done, it was not felt to be fully accurate of
baseline status.  Maintained on beta-blocker, ACE for ischemia
and HF.  Should titrate ACE/beta to HF goals based on repeat
echo (lisinopril 20/toprol 150).

c)rhythm; afib: has always been rate controlled, never
cardioverted.  POor control now and had sensation of
palpitations on night PTA.  Unclear if ratelead to CHF or CHF
lead to increased rate and component of ischemia?--Increaed
demand leading to ischemia vs. ischemia leading to tachy--
Patient maintained on metoprolol for rate control with good
affect. Had been on dilt but with ? heart failure, systolic-held
and went up on beta-blocker for control.
Concerning anti-coagulation, we are holding coumadin until
patient has outpatient colonoscopy-had guiac positive stools and
crit drop (also with neck hematoma after central line
placement.)  Scheduled for outpatient colonoscopy and then to
re-start coumadin then.

Shortness of breath/hypoxemia: CHF vs. post URI Reactive airways
disease vs. COPD vs. PE vs. pneumonia--ON admission, SOB felt
secondary to astham exacerbation-Patient acutely decompensated,
wheezy on exam, sent to unit on day 2 of admission for
intubation.  Treated with predniesone, flovent, azithromycin
then levaquin as well as nebs/inhalers.  HAd 5 day ICU stay and
then was transferred out.  By discharge, not wheezy satting well
on room air.  Felt to be RAD post bronchitis.  Was not fluid
overloaded on admit--was diuresed after ICU stay with lots of
fluids. On discharge satting well on room air.

Anemia at baseline/Crit drop/guiaic positive: Patient had crit
drop while in ICU.  She had a hematoma after central line
placement as well as guiac positive stools. Was on heparin
during this time for her afib, stopped at this time. She
stabilized after transfusion in ICU, and needed no further
transfusions.  Neck hematoma is resolving.  Guiac positive
stools-she is scheduled for outpatient colonoscopy.  Re-address
anti-coagulation for afib after this. Do not want her on iron
until after colonoscopy.

Elevated LFT's, tbili and PTT: After being off heparin (on it
for afib), stopped for crit drop in [**Name (NI) 102488**] PTT remained
elevated.  WAs on subcu heparin, lft's obtained which showed
mild transaminase elevation and t bili elevation.  Subcu heparin
stopped, RUQ U/S obtained showed fatty liver/h/o
cholecystectomy.  Lft's, t. bili and PTT trended down on
discharge.  Patient will need follow -up of these studies as an
outpatient. ? MEd affect.  Lipitor was increased from 10 to 40
given significant coronary disease--although unlikely to cause
acute elevations.

Hsitory of DM: Not on meds prior to admission.  Needs primary
care follow-up.

Hypothyroidism: Levoxyl continued, TSH normal

GERD: PRotonix continued, no acute issues.

General care: VIT D, calcium, multi-vitamins

History of Present Illness:
79 yo female with CAD s/p CABG in [**2129**], recent cath with only
LIMA-LAD patent, HTN, HLP, COPD, and afib who presents with 5
day history of red/maroon stools. Patient was at her PCP's
office earlier last week and was found to be anemic (HCT not in
system) and was planned for a colonscopy this week. She was at
home, and earlier today developed substernal chest pressure that
was persistent. She describes this pressure as a squeezing
sensation, different and worse than her usual anginal symptoms
for which she takes nitro. Usually her pain occurs with exertion
or at night when she's not wearing her oxygen and is limited to
her arm, but today it was also in her chest as well. She
described the pain as [**2155-9-26**] initially, and nitro at home did
not help, nor did increasing her O2 from 2-> 3L.
.
In the ED, initial VS: 97.8, 99, 116/, 24, 100%RA. Initially,
the patient was noted to have bright red blood on rectal exam.
She was tachycardic to the low 100s, but BP remained stable. She
received nitro SL and morphine which improved her CP to [**2155-3-20**].
Cardiology was consulted for the STD seen in the lateral leads,
but they felt this was likely c/w demand ischemia given her
significant anemia and severe coronary disease. She was given 2
units of PRBCs and 2 units of FFP prior to transfer. GI was
called, and felt the patient should have reversal of her INR
(4.5). She was given 5 mg IV vitamin K as well. Her BP remained
stable, and her HR improved to the 80s. She had a 20 and 16G PIV
placed. Her vitals prior to transfer to the MICu were 110/65,
89, 20, 98% 3L. She did complain of some dyspnea/tachypnea prior
to transfer, but her O2 sats remained 98% with 3L of O2.

Echo:The left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis
(LVEF = 20-30 %) with regional variation. There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. with severe global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**1-18**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with
elevated left atrial pressure. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior report (images

periventricular
and subcortical white matter consistent with sequelae of small
vessel ischemic
disease. The bilateral basal ganglia show small hypoattenuations
consistent
with old lacunar infarcts. There is calcification of the
intracranial carotid
artery. Also noted is a left maxillary sinus mucosal thickening.
The other
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.

CTA OF THE NECK AND HEAD: There is abrupt cutoff of the right
MCA at the
junction of the M1 and M2 segments. This represents a thrombus
within the
right MCA . Also noted is calcification of the bilateral carotid
bulbs. The
remaining intracranial and cervical vessels are unremarkable.
The vertebral
and carotid ostia are unremarkable. A stent is noted in the left
subclavian
artery which is patent.

Also noted are sternotomy wires, bibasilar atelectatic changes
in the
visualized lung apices and a hypoplastic or absent thyroid
gland. Clinical
correlation is recommended.

There are several enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, the largest
of which is
precarinal and measures 14.3 mm.

CT PERFUSION: There is increased mean transit time in a large
right MCA
territory distribution in the right frontoparietal region. This
is associated
with decreased cerebral blood flow but normal cerebral blood
volume. This
likely represents an acute large infarct with some mismatch
possibly
representing an area of penumbra.

Rotation of the C1 over C2 vertebra is likely positional in
nature.

IMPRESSION: Acute right MCA vascular territory infarct as
described above.

CT head [**2155-2-8**]
IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or edema.

HbA1c 5.5
LDL 33


Brief Hospital Course:
79 yo female with CAD s/p CABG with only patent LIMA-LAD, COPD,
HTN, afib who presents with hematochezia, anemia, and angina,
sent to MICU initally where she was transfused with HCT back up
to 31, c/b NSTEMI with CHF.
.
# Stroke: has h/o Afib but her anticoagulation was held in the
setting of acute GIB complicated by NSTEMI. It was felt she
would restart ASA 325mg upon discharge. The pt was intact
neurologically throughout admission until [**2-7**] when she was
found to have acute onset dysarthria, L facial droop, L
hemiparesis. Code stroke was called and pt was found to have R
MCA embolic infarct on CT head. She was sent emergently to neuro
IR for IA TPA and MERCI clot retrieval.  She was initially
transferred to the neuro ICU and has been continuing to improve
clinically.  Her coumadin has been re-started and her hematocrit
has remained stable.  Her LDL was 33 and HbA1c was 5.5.  Her INR
on day of transfer ([**2-14**]) was 3.1 and today's dose will be held.
 Please monitor daily for goal [**2-19**].
.
# Hematochezia: likely due to angiodysplasia vs diverticulosis
as pt had colonoscopy in [**2152**] with only polyps. on transfer out
of the MICU her HCT was up to 31 (was initially 22.5 on
admission) after 3U pRBC. While on the floor she was transfused
1 more unit of blood and her HCT was maintained around 30
without any evidence of GI bleeding (stools were without blood).
She was continued on [**Hospital1 **] po pantoprazole.  Her hematocrit has
remained stable in the low 30s.  Gastroenterology plans to
perform a colonoscopy as an outpatient in [**6-24**] weeks.  Given her
other comorbidities and stable hematocrit it was decided to
defer this procedure at this immediate time.
.
# NSTEMI: Patient has known bad coronary disease with diseased
grafts as well taking up to 3 NTG daily for anginal pain.
patient's initial ECG with afib with RVR and lateral STD and
TWI; most likely due to demand ischemia. Pt had CP and 1st set
CE was neg, but then subsequent had Trp peak up to 1.8 (CK 556,
CKMB 10.4) c/w NSTEMI in setting of acute lower GI bleed.
Cardiology was consulted and recommended holding anticoagulation
until she was stable from her GIB. Her chest pain improved with
transfusions, nitro, and morphine, and now pt has been CP free
while on the floor. she was started on metoprolol 25 tid,
atorvastatin 80mg. her lisinopril and imdur were held to avoid
hypotension in the setting of GIB.  Her lisinopril has been
resumed and her blood pressure has been well-controlled.
.
# Dyspnea/tachypnea: Patient has COPD at baseline, and uses O2
(2L) at night for comfort and angina with exertion. During the
day, she should be using her O2 but she has not been using it
due to difficulty with portability. Now with EF 20-30% severely
dropped form 50% in [**2153**], likely due to NSTEMI. Also likely
worsened initially in MICU in the setting of volume (blood, FFP,
and IVFs).  Diuresed well with IV lasix in the MICU and on the
floor. She was started on po 20mg lasix daily and maintained on
her fluticasone and ipratropium nebs.  She is currently doing
well on her home requirements of 2L O2 via nasal cannula.
.
# Afib: patient on metoprolol and coumadin as an outpatient.
Given her above h/o GIB complicated by NSTEMI, cardiology/GI
consults recommended that due to her CHADS2 score of 3 she
should be restarted on ASA 325mg once her GIB was stabilized. It
was felt that the pt would have this started upon d/c. Despite
these efforts the pt suffered from an embolic stroke entailed
above and therefore will be continued on coumadin with goal INR
[**2-19**].
.
# Hypothyroidism: cont levothyroxine
.
# DM2: RISS.  Glipizide may be resumed at the time of transfer.
.
# CKD: creat 1.3-1.5 at the time of presentation, now trending
down to 0.9-1.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the medical service and started on
a colonoscopy preparation, her pradexa was held and she was
started on a heparin drip.  She was taken to the GI suite on
[**2156-4-28**] for endoscopy which showed an ""ulcerated mass with
necrotic base highly suggestive of carcinoma"" in the cecum.  She
had a CT scan of the chest/abdomen/pelvis to assess for
metastasis and further define the tumor.  It confirmed
colonoscopy findings and did not show evidence of metastasis.

She was taken to the operating room for a right colectomy with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1120**] of colorectal surgery on [**2156-4-30**].  There was 500 cc of
estimated blood loss.Please refer to Dr.[**Name (NI) 3377**] operative note
for further details.    She was started on cipro/flagyl
prophylactically after the procedure. After a brief stay in the
PACU she was transferred to the floor but over the course of the
night had low urine output, her blood pressure dropped to the
systolic 80s/40s and her atrial fibrillation frequently took her
heart rate to the 120s-130s.  She was transferred to the ICU
given her extensive cardiac history and unclear etiology of her
hypotension -- cardiogenic vs. septic.  She was continued on
antibiotic coverage and the plan was for volume resuscitation
with close monitoring of other aspects of her clinical picture.
She was asymptomatic and felt well throughout the process,
though somewhat tired.

She was transfused one unit of PRBCs, volume resuscitated with
crystalloid and albumin and eventually her systolic pressures
returned to the 90s-100s systolic.  She was deemed stable for
transfer to the floor.  On POD 5 she reported passing flatus,
she was advanced in diet progressive to a low-residue regular
diet on POD 8.

Remaining aspects of her hospitalization, by systems:

Neuro: No issues.  Pain controlled on a regimen of IV and PO
medications when tolerating.  Mental status appropriate
throughout hospitalization.

Cardiac: Multiple cardiac issues assessed by cardiology service
preoperatively and which recommended continuing current care.
Multiple episodes of anginal chest pain relieved with sublingual
nitroglycerin.  No EKG changes until POD 7 when chest pain was
accompanied by questionable ischemic changes on EKG.  Cardiology
recommended nitroglycerin PRN as well as cycling enzymes which
returned at 0.05->0.05->0.04.  Her afib was monitored on
telemetry and she was treated with 5 mg IV lopressor q6 hours
when NPO and transitioned to 25 mg PO BID.

Respiratory:  Baseline used oxygen at home was kept on 2L oxygen
in the hospital and maintained good saturations in the high 90
percents.  She did have some respiratory difficulty and
increased oxygen requirement while in the ICU but this resolved
after effective diuresis.  At time of discharge satting 90s on
room air.

Heme:  Once the patient's hematocrit was stable, a heparin drip
was started to bridge her to coumadin therapy. However, patient
developed melenic stools and hematuria when heparin drip
restarted. All anticoagulation except aspirin was held and no
further episodes of bleeding occured. Patient's coumadin will
need to be restarted when her nutritional status is more
improved.

ID: Cipro/Flagyl initially post-operatively and dc'd on POD 7.
Afebrile throughout course. Complained of vaginal itching, given
single dose of oral diflucan.

[**Name (NI) 153**] Course
Pt was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**5-1**] for management of
hypotension and low urine output in setting of recent colectomy.

.
# Hypotension: Noted to be progressively hypotensive through
today (POD1) with concern for hypovolemia however could also be
related to evolving sepsis picture she is currently on
cipro/flagyl since last night. Given extensive cards history
could also be cardiogenic shock related to missed event given
her 500cc blood loss intraoperatively and prior hx of ischemic
event in setting of blood loss in 01/[**2155**]. Lower concern for
this given current clinical and exam status. Given hx of
recurrent UTIs (on home macrobid suppressive tx) could also be
related to urosepsis. Currently mentating at baseline. Plan to
volume resuscitate until increase in O2 requirement. She
received 1u pRBC on arrival to floor with 500cc LR IVF boluses x
2. Her BP improved to 90-110 wo pressors. She did not require a
CVL and declined this on her ICU consent form as well. NICOM was
placed which showed 33% change in CI, indicating likely fluid
responsiveness. Her UO improved to 20cc/hr but remained there
with crystalloid boluses. Per surgery recs, she was changed to
albumin 5% IVF hydration. She was given lasix for volume
overload XXXX.
She was broadened to vancomycin, zosyn and ciprofloxacin for
double GNR coverage overnight given higher likelihood of GI
etiology related to recent surgery and instrumentation. Given
her remarkable hemodynamic improvement overnight she was changed
back to cipro/flagyl. She was recultured for urine and blood.
Her EKG was checked and at baseline. Cardiac enzymes were cycled
and mildly elevated trop attributed to underlying CKD and
possible demand ischemia [**2-18**] tachycardia on presentation.
.
# CAD: Extensive cardiac hx including recent NSTEMI [**1-/2156**] in
setting of GIB and CVA at same time. Has been on home
dabigatran. Follows as outpt w Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 120**]. Increasing NSL use
for her anginal equivalent altho per cards notes, outpt cards is
not concerned for ischemic etiology. Last TTE 8/[**2156**]. She was
continued on Heparin SQ, 81mg asa and pneumoboots. Her
transfusion goals were for Hct<30 per cardiology recs
pre-operatively. EKG in the ICU was rechecked and at baseline.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled (see above).
.
# Afib: On dabigatran at home for other comorbidities, CHADS2
score is 6. Currently in afib. Her home betablocker was held for
hemodynamic monitoring. She was noted to be in 100-130s afib
with mild SOB but otherwise comfortable. Her betablocker was
restarted on [**5-2**] and XXXX.
.
# CHF: Systolic EF 35% on TTE [**8-/2155**] and global LV hypokinesis.
Cards consulted pre-op w recommendation to gently diurese for
vol overload on presentation - last given 20mg IV lasix [**4-29**].
Pleural effusion on AM chest xray and crackles on exam on
transfer to the ICU. Home diuretic was held on admission to the
ICU for BP stabilization and restarted XXX.
.
# Cecal Mass: necrotic appearance on colonoscopy concerning for
malignancy. S/p colectomy [**4-30**]. Pathology is pending.
.
# CKD: unclear baseline but likely 0.9-1.1. On outpt procrit.
Creatinine elevated on admission. FENA this AM 1%, concern for
possible ATN related to hypovolemia. Repeat urine lytes notable
for FeNA = 0.1% indicating prerenal hypovolemic picture. Urine
output was monitored and responded to IVF boluses w increase to
20cc/hour.
.
# COPD/ASthma: On home O2 via nasal cannula at baseline. Unclear
pulmonary disease hx. She was continued on home dose
fluticasone, and spiriva. Albuterol held for tachycardia and
restarted on XXX.

Discharge Diagnosis:
cecal adenocarcinoma


Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital because of a bleed from your
gastrointestinal tract.  It was discovered that you had a
colonic mass upon further investigation and you then had a
surgical procedure called a right colectomy.

Regarding your anticoagulation, you have been very mal nourished
and when our surgical team attempted to anticoagulate you you
developed further GI bleeding and some blood in your urine. Your
anticoagulation has been on hold for the time being. The
rehabilitation facility should restart this anticoagulation at a

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Altered mental status.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 56-year-old man
with known brain cancer (oligodendroglioma), who presented to
the ED on [**3-13**] with worsening mental status and a left
leg ulcer.  Patient had been increasingly confused over the
past few days and possibly had a fall a few days prior to
admission.

On the day of admission, VNA noticed an abscess on the left
leg and sent patient to the Emergency Room, where he was
found to be afebrile, but hypotensive with a systolic blood
pressure of 95.  Patient finished chemotherapy and also had
some partial seizures last week.  He has had seizures since
[**2165**].  Head CT [**3-13**] showed new bleed around temporal
[**Doctor Last Name 534**] of right lateral ventricle and at tip of the inferior
right temporal lobe.  In the Emergency Room, he received more
than 3 liters of fluid.  He was given stress-dosed steroids,
and he had an I&D of his left leg ulcer, and was started on
Zosyn.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Oligodendroglioma versus oligoastrocytoma anaplastic
diagnosed [**2166-3-24**].  [**2166-3-24**] he had a MRI for
infertility.  Later in the year he had temozolomide, and he
has had persistent seizures.  In [**2167-12-24**], he had an
increasing enhancement and was started on radiation therapy
as well as temozolomide and dexamethasone.
2. History of line sepsis.
3. Neurologic symptoms, encephalopathy secondary to tumor,
recent increase in weakness and inability to ambulate
possibly secondary to steroid myopathy.  In addition, he has
a left field cut in vision.
4. Hyperglycemia (steroid induced).

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1. Celebrex 200 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Lamictal 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3. Keppra 1500 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4. Dexamethasone 2 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5. Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
6. Valproate 250 mg p.o. q.i.d.
7. Neurontin 400 mg p.o. t.i.d.
8. Inderal 60 mg p.o. q.d.
9. Seroquel 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.
10. Ativan 0.5 mg p.o. t.i.d. prn.

ALLERGIES:  Sulfa causes hives.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient is an anesthesiologist.  He lives
with his wife.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was admitted to the
MICU for close observation overnight, and the patient did
well.  The following day he was transferred to the floor and
remained stable throughout.

1. Intracranial hemorrhage:  Repeat CT on [**3-14**] showed
no change from the previous day.  Neurology and Neurosurgery
were consulted.  Neurosurgery team felt that the bleed is
stable and there is no need for surgical intervention at this
time.  The goal is to keep the systolic blood pressure less
than 140.  No new neurologic deficits.  Hematocrit dropped
from 33 to 30 during this admission, which is felt to be
insignificant.

2. Hypotension:  Patient was hypotensive on admission, but
quickly responded to fluid challenge and blood pressure has
since been greater than 100 systolic.  Patient is
hemodynamically stable and has been afebrile since admission.
Was given stress-dose steroids for two days, and was switched
back to dexamethasone.  Also Inderal was held on admission,
and has not been restarted as blood pressure has been less
than 120 throughout admission.

3. Left leg cellulitis:  Patient was started on Zosyn for two
days and changed to Augmentin for one day.  He was finally
changed to Levaquin on the day of discharge as the patient
has concomitant questionable pneumonia.  Continue wet-to-dry
dressing changes b.i.d. with saline.

4. Hyperglycemia secondary to steroids:  Patient was
continued on regular insulin-sliding scale.

5. Hypertension:  Inderal was held on admission.  Blood
pressure is still borderline low, so Inderal was discontinued
altogether.

6. Seizure disorder:  Patient had been having seizures
lately.  Was taking Lamictal, valproate, and Keppra on
admission.  Neurology recommended stopping Lamictal, which
was done.  Valproate dose was increased on [**3-14**] and is
still subtherapeutic on the day of discharge.  This will need
to be followed up as an outpatient with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**],
neuro-oncologist, was e. mailed to be made aware of the
subtherapeutic valproate level.

7. Brain cancer:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] from the Brain [**Hospital 341**] Clinic will
follow up with the patient for one month.  For now, we will
begin a dexamethasone taper 2 mg p.o. q.d. for two weeks,
then 1 mg p.o. q.d. for two weeks, then 0.5 mg p.o. for two
weeks, then 0.5 mg p.o. q.o.d. for four weeks, then off.

8. Hypoxia:  Patient was noted to have an increased O2
requirement once on the regular medical floor saturating 90%
on room air from 97% on room air.  Chest x-ray on admission
was clear, but repeat chest x-ray two days later showed a
small bilateral pleural effusion with a questionable
infiltrate in the left lower lobe.  Decision was made to
treat with Levaquin for 10 days and encouraged use of
incentive spirometer.

9. Code status:  Full.

10. Low back pain:  Chronic.  Responds well to Percocet.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Intracranial hemorrhage outside of oligoastrocytoma.
2. Brain cancer.
3. Left lower extremity cellulitis.
4. Question of pneumonia.

FOLLOW-UP INSTRUCTIONS:  Patient is to followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**]
on [**3-21**].  He is also to followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in
two weeks.  He is also to have a followup MRI on [**3-21**].

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Patient is at baseline, somewhat
lethargic, but able to answer all questions.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Keppra 1500 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2. Neurontin 400 mg p.o. t.i.d.
3. Regular insulin-sliding scale.
4. Tylenol prn.
5. Percocet prn.
6. Valproate 500 mg p.o. q.8h.
7. Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
8. Dexamethasone taper as described above.
9. Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q.d. for 10 days.

AP CHEST 4:20 A.M. ON [**9-27**]

HISTORY: GI bleed following intubation and right subclavian line

repositioning.

IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**9-26**] at 5:15 a.m.:

Lung volumes are low and mild pulmonary edema has worsened.
Perihilar
opacification on the right could be asymmetric edema or
developing pneumonia.
ET tube and right subclavian line are in standard placements. No
pneumothorax
or pleural effusion. Heart size normal.

PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH

CLINICAL DETAILS: Post repositioning of right subclavian line.

FINDINGS: Endotracheal tube at the precarinal level. The
inferior tip of the
right subclavian line lies at the inferior level of the SVC.
Minor kink noted
at its cutaneous entry.

Increased opacity at the left costophrenic angle likely due to a
small pleural
effusion. The lungs are otherwise clear.


Brief Hospital Course:
In the ED on presentation pt was tachcardic at 118, had an O2
sat of 93% on RA up to 98%on 6L, and vomited 500cc of blood with
clots, the decision was made to intubate the patient for airway
protection, 2 liters of NS and 3 Units PRBCs were given while
waiting for an Abd CT scan in the ED her pressure dropped to low
80s/40s, nursing decided to transport pt to MICU, bypassing CT
scan, MICU team and GI met pt in MICU pts BP measure at
140s/80s, Right subclavian was placed, GI performed gastric
lavage and scoped pt in MICU. Discovered bleeding esophageal
varices in the lower [**1-1**] of the esophagus and banded x 4 as well
as non-bleeding gastric varices in the cardia.
.
In the MICU, pt was extubated on [**2176-9-28**].  She began to develop
a non-productive cough.  She denies any recent bleeding. She
denies any nausea/vomiting/diarrhea.  No chest pain/tightness.
No lightheadedness.  No fever/chills.  She states she feels
comfortable
ROS:  + non-productive cough

1) Upper GI Bleed/Esophageal Varicies: Unknown cause, ?
secondary due history of Autoimmune hepatitis, GI evaluated and
banded times 4. She received 5 days of octreotide and Hct was
stable since banding. US shows normal flow in hepatic and portal
veins and no ascites.

.
2)BP
Pt initially hypotensive most likely due to hypovolemia but
normalized after fluid resuccitation.  On transfer from the MICU
to the floor, she was slightly hypertensive with SBP in the
140s.  According to her family, she has no history of
hypertension and was on no hypertensive meds at home.  We will
leave her on nadolol and have her follow up with her PCP.
[**Name Initial (NameIs) **] Nadolol 20 mg PO QD

1. Increased intrinsic signal abnormality within the L2-3 disc
with surrounding endplate signal changes since the previous MRI
of [**2161-9-19**]. Subtle soft tissue prominence is also identified,
but no definite fluid collection is seen. No evident paraspinal
soft tissue prominence seen. These findings could be due to
advancing degenerative change or due to low-grade infection.
Given the clinical suspicion of infection, further evaluation
with repeat lumbar spine study with gadolinium is recommended.
Given patient's low EGFR, a consent could be obtained and,
clinically, it should be determined whether the study is
important for any decision making.
2. Multilevel degenerative changes are identified as above with
spinal stenosis at L3-4 and L4-5 levels as well as at L2-3
level.
.
[**2162-1-10**] CT abdomen/pelvis IMPRESSION: 1. Right-sided pleural
effusion, unchanged compared with the previous study. 2.
Moderate-to-large ascites, unchanged compared with previous
study. 3. No reaccumulation of the retroperitoneal fluid
collection which was previously drained.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is an 56 year old male with hepatitis C
cirrhosis/HCC s/p liver transplant ([**2156**]) with recurrent
decompensated hepatitis C cirrhosis, ESRD on HD, diabetes
mellitus type II, who was admitted for acute on chronic low back
pain and was found to have coag-negative staph bacteremia and
L2-3 discitis / osteomyelitis.
.
Initial [**Doctor Last Name 3271**]-[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 679**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]:
.
# GPC Bactermia: He has had several prior episodes of bacteremia
requiring removal of his HD catheter.  Blood culture from his HD
line on [**2161-12-2**] grew coag negative staph.  Spinal plain films
from his admission on [**2161-12-1**] were unrevealing.  CT abdomen
pelvis on [**2161-11-4**] showed no acute findings concerning for
infection.  His HD catheter was removed on [**2161-11-5**] after an
early HD session.  Noncontrast MRI on [**2161-11-6**] showed possible
low grade discitis at L2-3.  Multiple consecutive blood cultures
from [**11-2**] to [**11-12**] grew coagulase negative staph.  His continued
bacteremia was concerning for a persistent source of infection.
TTE and TEE showed no evidence of endocarditis or paravalvular
abscess.  ID was consulted and recommended an 8 week antibiotic
course.  He was treated with Vancomycin following HD protocol
from [**2161-11-4**] through [**2161-11-11**] without clearing the bacteremia, at
which point he was switched to Daptomycin.  Gallium and bone
scans showed no evidence of infection except for the region of
discitis at L2-3.  His Daptomycin dose was increased from 500 mg
Q48H to 650 mg Q48H on [**2161-11-19**] per ID recs for 8 week course to
be completed with last dose on [**2162-1-7**] per ID.  A new tunneled
HD catheter was placed on [**2161-11-20**].  He has subsequent clinical
deterioration with new low grade fevers to 100.0 on [**2161-11-23**] and
100.1 on [**2161-11-26**], blood culture positive for GPCs on [**2161-11-24**],
and worsening back pain with new radiation to the buttocks.
Lumbar spine plain film on [**2161-11-26**] showed progressive
destructive changes.  Lumbar spine MRI with contrast on [**2161-11-27**]
showed increased collapse of the superior endplate of L3 and an
epidural soft tissue mass spanning L2 and L3, which most likely
reflects a phlegmon and causes moderate to severe canal
encroachment.  He received dialysis immediately after the MRI
study and again the next day.  His PICC line was pulled and the
tip sent for culture.  His HD line was pulled on [**2161-11-28**] after
dialysis.  Ortho Spine was consulted regarding the possible need
for surgical debridement of the phlegmon. Patient chose to
pursue surgery.
.
# Left Flank Erythema: He had significant leakage from a prior
paracentesis site noted on [**2161-11-17**] with some flank swelling
from subcutaneous fluid.  It was sutured on [**2161-11-18**] and stopped
leaking.  A few days later on [**2161-11-21**], his left flank was noted
to have increased swelling, erythema, pruritis, and tenderness.
He has continued to have symptoms in this area.  The itching is
fairly well controlled with Sarna lotion.  Abdominal wall US on
[**2161-11-28**] did not identify any drainable fluid collections.
.
# Back pain: He has acute on chronic back pain, which was his
initial reason for presenting to the ED.  Prior MRI on [**2161-9-20**]
showed lower lumbar levoscoliosis with severe spinal canal
stenosis and severe degenerative disc, endplate, and facet joint
disease.  Spine Xray on admission did not show any acute
fracture.  CT abdomen and pelvis did not show any acute changes.
 A Pain Service consult was called and did not believe that a
procedural intervention would be helpful, though TENS may be
useful as an outpatient.  Noncontrast MRI on [**2161-11-6**] showed
possible low grade discitis at L2-3.  Later gallium and bone
scans were consistent with an infection at this location.  His
back pain on [**2161-11-21**] was significantly worse after walking to
the bathroom and he required additional pain meds for the first
time in many days.  His Oxycontin dose was increased to 20 mg PO
BID on [**2161-11-24**].  His back pain has worsened since then with new
radiation to the buttocks.
.
# Altered mental status:  He was in grade III encephalopathy on
transfer to the liver service, stuporous and unable to give more
than single word answers to questions.  He has cleared
significantly since admission, and was fairly clear even during
his active bacteremia.  His initial MS changes were most likely
due to medication effects (received Dilaudid 1 mg IV and
Lorazepam 3 mg IV total over 24 hours for back pain).  Infection
was likely contributing, particularly given his associated
leukocytosis with left shift and persistent GPC bacteremia.
Baseline hepatic encephalopathy from from decompensated liver
disease was also a likely contributor.  Diagnostic paracentesis
on admission showed no evidence of SBP, and subsequent
therapeutic paracentesis has also showed no evidence of SBP.  He
has remained quite clear since his initial presentation.  He was
continued on his home regimen of Lactulose and Rifaximin for
most of his stay.
.
# Hyponatremia:  He was hyponatremic on admission with Na 125,
which largely resolved after HD.  It is likely due to his
underlying cirrhosis, but SIADH from severe pain may also have
played a role.  He has been mildly hyponatremic at various times
during his admission.
.
# ESLD:  He was transplanted in [**2156**] for HCV cirrhosis, with
subsequent HCV recurrence and cirrhosis of the transplanted
liver.  His course has been complicated by esophageal varices,
coagulopathy, encephalopathy, and refractory ascites.  His MELD
was 33 on admission.  It has improved to the high 20s during the
course of his stay.  He was continued on Pantoprazole and
Propranolol per his home regimen.
.
# Liver Transplant History:  He was previously on Tacrolimus 0.5
mg PO BID.  This was decreased to 0.5 mg daily on [**2161-11-3**], and
further decreased to 0.5 mg every other day on [**2161-11-6**].  His
goal level was set at <5 and his Tactolimus doses were held
briefly.  His Tacro level was 3.9 on [**2161-11-15**] and Tacrolimus was
restarted at 0.5 mg every other day.  His levels have since
dropped below 2.
.
# Adrenal Insufficiency: He has a history of adrenal
insufficiency and is on chronic Hydrocortisone 10 mg PO QAM and
5 mg PO QHS.  He did not require stress dose steroids during
this admission, though it was considered initially.
.
# Diabetes mellitus, type II:  He was previously well controlled
on his home regimen of NPH 55 units [**Hospital1 **] and Humalog sliding
scale.  His glucose levels have been labile recently, likely due
to the changes in his dialysis schedule, dietary changes, and
the stress of infection.  No changes were made to his Insulin
regimen.
.
# ESRD: He is usually on a MWF hemodialysis schedule.  He had an
early session on [**2161-11-5**] prior to HD catheter removal and an HD
holiday.  His electrolytes were closely monitored and he had
back to back sessions on [**2161-11-10**] and [**2161-11-11**].  He was started on
Calcitriol on [**2161-11-5**] based on his elevated PTH level of 135
from [**2161-11-4**].  His phosphate levels have been mildly elevated,
and he was started on Sevelamer 800 mg PO TID.  He was also
started on Nephrocaps.  A new tunneled HD catheter was placed on
[**2161-11-20**].  He had dialysis three days in a row from [**2161-11-18**]
through [**2161-11-20**].  He then returned to a MWF schedule.  With his
recurrent bacteremia on [**2161-11-24**], his new tunneled catheter was
pulled on [**2161-11-28**].  He has tolerated the disruptions in his
dialysis schedule well, without any significant problems. [**Name (NI) 3003**]
to spine surgery, patient had temporary line placed on [**2161-12-7**]
and received dialysis on [**2161-12-7**] and [**2161-12-8**].
.
# Depression: Paroxetine was continued per his home regimen.
.
# Nutrition: He was kept on a low sodium, diabetic diet.  After
his HD catheter was pulled, he was temporarily placed on a more
restrictive diet.  These restrictions were later lifted after it
was clear he could tolerate a more regular diet despite his
disrupted HD schedule.  PO intake was encouraged and he was
provided Ensure supplements and Beneprotein with meals.  He was
seen by Nutrition who recommended Dobbhoff placement and
initiation of tube feeds which he tolerated well.
.
SICU course:
Patient underwent spine surgery for debridement of L2-L3
osteomyelitis on [**2161-12-9**]. Admitted to surgical ICU afterwards,
intubated. Difficulty weaning off ventilator for one week due to
fluid overload. Received CVVH but eveually transitioned to HD.
Required pressors from [**2161-12-9**] - [**2161-12-15**]. Post-pyloric Dubhoff
tube placed. Treated empirically with Zosyn for VAP.
Post-pyloric Dubhoff placed and tubefeeds initiated. Wound
culture from spine grew Coagulase negative Staphylococcus
resistent to daptomycin, switched to linezolid at ID
recommendation. Placed on hydrocortisone given known adrenal
insufficiency. Transferred to the floor on [**2161-12-17**].
.
[**Doctor Last Name 3271**]-[**Doctor Last Name 679**] course # 2:
On the floor, patient was initially afebrile with no
leukocytosis. He was continued on linezolid and ciprofloxacin
was started empirically for SBP prophylaxis. Therapeutic and
diagnostic paracentesis were performed. Negative for SBP. CT
abdomen/pelvis with contrast was obtained to look for
retroperitoneal bleed, which was negative. There was a pararenal
collection of fluid which was drained and culture negative.
Multiple paracentesis were negative for infection, but given
continual leukocytosis, fever, and mental status changes,
patient was kept on linezolid, ceftriaxone, and po vancomycin
for broad spectrum coverage. His continued to develop
encephalopathy and lactulose doses had to be closely titrated.
Patient was continued on dialysis. He worked with physical
therapy to regain strength and made minimal progress.
.
Transplant Surgery/SICU course

Patient was transferred again to the ICU on [**1-10**] under the
transplant team for worsening lactic acidosis up to 12.6. He had
a CT scan demonstrating no evidence of bowel ischemia and stable
ascites. Linezolid was d/c'd for possible association with
lactic acidosis and was changed to tigecycline for SBP coverage.
He was started on CVVH on [**1-10**] after transfer and the lactate
improved to 5.6. Upon transfer to the ICU pt had mild bloody
emesis, so an NGT lavage was performed and was positive. An EGD
on [**1-11**] demonstrated hypertensive gastropathy with friable
mucosa, but no local site to intervene. His Hct was stable after
transfusing 3U pRBC before the EGD. He needed to be intubated
for the EGD and was kept intubated for aspiration risks given
the amounts of blood in the stomach. On [**1-12**] a postpyloric
dobhoff feeding tube was placed. The CVVH filter was clogged and
lactate went up to 11.2, but then decreased after resuming CVVH.
On [**1-13**] Vancomycin/Cefepime was started as WBC increased from
6.1 to 13.9. A decision was made to take him off the liver and
the kidney transplantion lists, as patient seemed too ill to be
a candidate. After long discussions with the family about his
poor prognosis, patient was made DNR/DNI on [**1-15**]. CVVH
continued. On [**1-16**] patient was made [**Name (NI) 3225**], pt was extubated and
died on [**1-17**] at 5:49 am. Autopsy was denied by the family.

IMAGING:
CXR [**7-1**]

ET tube is 5.5 cm above the carina. NG tube tip is out of view
below the
diaphragms. There are low lung volumes. There is
mild-to-moderate
cardiomegaly. There is mild pulmonary edema. Right pleural
effusion is
small-to-moderate in amount. Right central catheter tip is in
the right
atrium. There is evidence of pneumothorax.
.
CXR [**7-2**]
ET tube tip is at the level of the carina and should be
repositioned. NG tube tip is in the stomach. Side port is distal
to the EG junction.
Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Right supraclavicular
catheter
remains in place. No other interval changes.
.
[**7-2**] CXR #2 ET tube tip is 5.6 cm above the carina. NG tube tip
is in the stomach. There are low lung volumes. There is mild
cardiomegaly. Right supraclavicular catheter tip is in the right
atrium. Moderate right pleural effusion has increased from [**7-1**]. Left lower lobe atelectasis has worsened. Pulmonary edema
has almost resolved.
.
[**7-4**] CXR
IMPRESSION:
1. Stable right pleural effusion and right lower lobe
atelectasis.
2. Stable left lower lobe airspace opacity.
3. Stable mild pulmonary vascular congestion and cardiomegaly.
.
[**2161-7-8**]: Rib films:
1. Left anterolateral rib fractures without substantial
displacement.
2. New right lower lobe opacity suggesting either atelectasis or
pneumonia.
3. Mildly prominent small bowel caliber with many air-fluid
levels. The
appearance is not fully characterized here. Although suspected
to represent
an ileus, further clinical and radiographic evaluation may be
helpful with
small bowel obstruction not completely excluded.
.
[**2161-7-10**]: T and L spine
By verbal report, no evidence of acute fracture.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 56-year-old man with liver failure and recurrent
admissions for hepatic encephalopathy who returns with
hematochezia and hematemesis.
.
# GI BLEED: Source thought to be form teeth extraction as well
as possible rectal varices/hemorrhoids. Intubated for airway
protection in setting of large volume UGIB. EGD did not show
bleeding esophageal varices. Kept on octreotide and Pantoprazole
gtt until these findings were available. Presented with HCT
10.8, so massive transfusion protocol initiated, received 13U
PRBC between both OSH, ED and ICU, plus plateletes and FFP.
Access was with PIV 16g x 2, femoral Cordis. HCTs stayed stable
without further transfusions. He was weaned off of pressors on
[**7-2**]. Received Ceftriaxone for post-GI bleeding ppx in a
cirrhotic patient. OMFS consulted and had no additional surgical
recommendations for his gums/mouth.  Cordis removed [**7-4**].  On
the floor, patient bleeding stopped, and patient's hematocrit
remained stable.

# ENTEROCOCCAL BACTEREMIA:  Confirmed with outside dialysis
center that blood cultures positive for enterococci were drawn
through dialysis line.  Enterococcos was vancomycin sensitive;
initially on linezolid and then daptomycin, but switched to
vancomycin one final sensitivities were available.  Patient was
afebrile and without leukocytosis.  A TTE was negative for
vegetations and infectious disease did not feel strongly about
pursuing a TEE.  Patient will remain on vancomycin, dosed at
dialysis, through [**7-17**].  His tunneled dialysis line was removed
by IR on [**7-9**] and replaced on [**7-10**] without any complication.
.
VENTILATOR ASSOCIATED PNA:  Patient with evidence of VAP after
intubation.  He finished an 8 day course of cefepime,
levofloxacin, and vancomycin.  His 02 sats remained normal and
he was encouraged to use his incentive spirometer.
.
# LIVER FAILURE:  Patient is currently listed for another liver
[**Month/Day (4) **] with kidney.  HIs LFTs and coags remained at
baseline.  A diagnostic paracentesis showed no evidence of SBP.
He received a therapeutic paracentesis (5L removed) on [**7-7**].
Patient was continued on tacrolimus, bactrim, lactulose, and
rifaxamin.  He was confused after extubation, but this was
related to ICU delirium and side-effect of multiple sedating
medications.
.
# ESRD: Patient on hemodialysis as outpatient.  Awaiting dual
liver/kidney [**Month/Day (4) **].  Mr. [**Known lastname 54381**] was dialyzed Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday during this admission.
.
# ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY:  Mr. [**Known lastname 54381**] was continued on his home
dose of hydrocortisone.
.
# THROMBOCYTOPENIA: Platelet count at baseline. Likely due to
splenomegaly and decreased thrombopoetin.  Patient's platelets
were monitored throughout admission.
.
# DM2:  Patient's insulin was initially held while he was NPO.
His NPH was slowly uptitrated, and he was discharged on 40 units
[**Hospital1 **].  This can be uptitrated to his home dose as an outpatient.
.
# CHRONIC BACK PAIN:  Patient with long-standing history of back
pain.  Mr. [**Known lastname 54381**] reports that he has multiple slipped disks.
Lumbar and thoracic XRAYs showed no evidence of acute fractures.
.
# RIB FRACTURE:  Mr. [**Known lastname 54381**] fell out of bed in the ICU in the
setting of delirium and multiple sedating medications.  He
complained of left-sided pain, and XRAYs showed: ""left
anterolateral rib fractures without substantial displacement.""
He was treated symptomatically for pain, and symptoms had
improved at time of discharge.

vancomycin to treat this infection. You will complete your 14
day course of vancomycin on [**2161-7-17**].
.
We did XRAYS of your spine, which showed chronic degenerative
changes.  There were no acute fractures seen on these films.
You would benefit from physical therapy as an outpatient.  You
also suffered a small rib fracture on the left.  Your symptoms
will improve with time, but please call your doctor if you have
worsening pain on your left side.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 20904**] is a 73 year-old man with a history of recent TURP
([**3-28**]) who presents with respiratory failure and UTI.
.
Per family, the patient was generally feeling well until one day
prior to admission when he ""wasn't feeling that great"" and felt
as though he was ""coming down with something"". A slight fever
(100) was noted along with chills. Took tylenol and Dayquil.
Additionally noted a burning sensation and blood in urine.
Additionally noted a cough since last week with sputum, no
blood.
.
Regarding his breathing, the family felt that this was generally
unchanged. He has had increasing DOE, worsening over the last
few months. He gets SOB after one flight of stairs. He does not
get chest pains. Family has also noted significant weight over
last few months, mostly in abdomen.

EMS reports show an initial BP of 124/103 with a RR of 30 and O2
of 89% on room air. Their notes indicate that the patient was
""sitting in bed shaking violently. States he can't breath.""
.
In the ED, BP was initially 224/91, HR 120, RR 35, 99% on
unclear amount of oxygen. Spiked to 104.8. Blood pressures
trended down (200s to 80s systolic). When an EKG showed inferior
ST-elevations, a code STEMI was called. Before taking the
patient to the cath lab, it was noted that BPs were unequal so a
CTA was obtained. This was negative for dissection and initially
was thought to show a PE. Soon thereafter, the patient was
intubated with a propofol gtt started. Was also given labetolol
IV for hypertension. Soon after, blood pressure fell to 118/56,
then to 80s systolic. A total of 5+ liters of normal saline were

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSEMENT/PLAN: 73 yo M s/p TURP procedure c/b UTI resistant
to ciprofloxacin, developed urosepsis requiring intubation and
ICU stay, also developed atrial flutter this admission.
.
# UROSEPSIS due to E. Coli: Urosepsis was felt to be secondary
to recent procedure, which placed patient at high risk for UTI.
He received Cipro post-procedure but on presentation had a
markedly positive UA. Urine & blood cultures grew E.coli. Blood
cultures with E.coli were sensitive to zosyn and ceftriaxone but
resistant to cipro; ceftriaxone was given. Changed antibiotics
to Ceftriaxone -> Cefazolin IV -> Keflex PO, currently started
on Meropenem IV on day of discharge. Changed from Keflex to
Meropenem due to possibility of AIN, rising creatinine as well
as urine with eos. Will need to complete 2 week course of
antibiotics with 5 additional days of Meropenem.
.
# Atrial flutter: The patient had developed atrial flutter with
poor rate control, without prior history. Increased po
metoprolol to 100 TID for rate control. The patient was started
on heparin in the ICU, then bridging with lovenox to coumadin. .
EP consulted about treatment, after discussion with family,
family wanted to pursue option of anticoagulation prior to
cardioversion. They did not want TEE and cardioversion during
this hospitalization. INR 3.1 on day of discharge, decreased
coumadin from 5 -> 4mg on day of discharge, holding tonight's
dose. Pt will need frequent INR checks until stabilized. Pt will
need to follow up with General cardiology 2weeks after discharge
for managment of atrial flutter as well as CAD.
.
# CAD: Pt without prior history of CAD or MI, however ECG and
echocardiogram revealed mild LVH with regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction consistent with CAD. Pt was initially
started on low dose lisinopril, however holding due to worsening
creatinine. Would restart once creatinine at baseline 1.2-1.5.
Pt already on aspirin, simvastatin and metoprolol. He will need
follow up with general cardiology for mangament of atrial
flutter as well as CAD.
.
# Acute on chronic kidney disease: Baseline creatinine is
variable, though 1.7 in ICU seemed somewhat elevated compared to
[**10-18**] when SCr was 1.2. There are CT findings suggestive of mild
hydro on the right though no stone was seen. Also has an
atrophic left kidney. Increasing creatinine with +eos in urine,
?AIN from antibiotics, changed Keflex to Meropenem IV. Metformin
also discontinued. Would check daily creatinine levels to
monitor for improvement.
.
# Diabetes: Oral hypoglycemics were intially held given the
patient's acute renal failure, also with dye load from CT
imaging. However, restarted with improvement in renal function.
Fingersticks well controlled on oral agents and sliding scale
humalog. Discontinued Metformin due to worsening renal function.
Would need to restart once creatinine improved.
.
# Hyperlipidemia: Continued on home regimen of simvastatin
.
# Hypoxia/resp failure (resolved): Extubated o/n [**Date range (1) 13864**].
Unclear etiology of hypoxic failure. Initially felt to be
secondary to PE, though the second read is unclear. There is no
infliltrate or failure on CXR. Given recent admission, DFA for
influenza was performed and was negative. There were some
changes consistent with emphysema on CT, though there are no
wheeze noted at this time.  Sputum culture was unremarkable.
.
Pt is being discharged to [**Hospital **] rehab facility. He is to
follow up with cardiology for management of CAD as well as
atrial flutter.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 41-year-old male who
presented with new shortness of breath in early [**Month (only) **] of this
year.  An echocardiogram at an outside hospital showed new
dilated cardiomyopathy.

He first noted symptoms on approximately the [**Hospital1 107**] Day
weekend.  He described his symptoms as similar to asthmatic
symptoms.  This progressed to severe orthopnea, a symptom he
had no previously had causing him to sit upright and gasp for
breath at night.  He used his friend's albuterol nebulizers
with minimal improvement.  He denies lower extremity edema.
His shortness of breath at this point was severely limiting
his activity, walking 20 to 30 feet with severe dyspnea.  He
felt better leaning forward.  He also describes decreased
appetite.

At the beginning of [**Month (only) **] he saw his primary care physician
who felt he was having an asthma exacerbation and gave him
intravenous Solu-Medrol, and the patient relayed a vague
story of going into sinus tachycardia with a heart rate in
the 120s, a fingerstick in the 500s, been sent to the
Emergency Department and admitted to [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] Hospital.
A chest x-ray showed a question of a left upper lobe
pneumonia.  He was given intravenous antibiotics; ceftriaxone
and azithromycin.  He was discharged from that hospital on
[**7-7**].  An echocardiogram during that admission showed
global hypokinesis, 4-chamber dilatation, an ejection
fraction of 10% to 15%.  There were no previous
echocardiograms.

The patient denies antecedent upper respiratory infection or
recent diarrheal illness.  No rash.  No joint pains.  Denies
a history of exertional chest pain, previous orthopnea, or
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or lower extremity edema.

In the week between discharge from [**Hospital3 **] Hospital and
admission to [**Hospital1 69**] he felt
better with decreased dyspnea on exertion, increased exercise
tolerance, and decreased lower extremity edema.  His blood
pressure previously had been 130s to 190s; he would take it
at work.  His cholesterol status is unknown.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Newly diagnosed dilated cardiomyopathy.
2.  Moderate mitral regurgitation.
3.  Global hypokinesis.
4.  Newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.
5.  Elevated liver function tests.
6.  Asthma; no previous steroids.
7.  Pneumonia, status post ceftriaxone and azithromycin.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:   Azmacort, NPH insulin 25 units
q.a.m. and 10 units q.p.m., a course of Ceftin (ended on
[**7-14**]).

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives in [**Location (un) 23708**].  He has a human
immunodeficiency virus positive partner (female), positive
tobacco history times 20 years, previous heavy drinker (now
social), very remote cocaine use.

FAMILY HISTORY:   One uncle with coronary artery disease and
a sister with Grave's disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Pulse of 114, blood
pressure of 122/88, 98% on room air. In general, he was a
large man, in no acute distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and
throat showed extraocular muscles were intact.  Pupils were
equal, round, and reactive to light.  The oropharynx was
clear without lesions, 10 cm of jugular venous distention in
the neck.  Lungs were clear to auscultation without crackles;
however, decreased air movement was noted bilaterally.  Heart
was fourth heart sound and first heart sound and second heart
sound regular without murmurs.  The abdomen was obese.
Sacral and abdominal wall edema.  Bowel sounds were present.
It was soft.  Extremities showed 4+ edema, warm.  Neurologic
examination was nonfocal.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  White blood cell
count of 9.7, hematocrit of 39, mean cell volume of 88,
platelets of 251.  Blood urea nitrogen of 16, creatinine
of 0.8, glucose of 168.  AST of 79, ALT of 340,
thyroid-stimulating hormone of 0.9, alkaline phosphatase
of 186, albumin of 3.2, total bilirubin of 1.2.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Liver ultrasound from the outside
hospital showed fatty infiltrate, no ascites, bilateral
pleural effusions, normal portal flow.

Transthoracic echocardiogram at the outside hospital on
[**7-6**] showed dilated left atrium of 5.6 cm, dilated left
ventricle with severe global hypokinesis, ejection fraction
of 10% to 15%, moderate mitral regurgitation, dilated right
ventricle with moderate global dysfunction, mild tricuspid
regurgitation, pulmonary artery pressure in the 30s.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was noted to be in severe
heart failure with dilated cardiomyopathy based on the
outside hospital records, the etiology of which was unclear.

He was sent to the catheterization laboratory which revealed
a middle left anterior descending artery lesion of 80%,
status post stent.  The right coronary artery was totally
occluded.  The left circumflex had a moderate ostial lesion
which was not intervened upon.  His pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure was 35 mmHg to 40 mmHg.  His cardiac index was
1.4 L/kg/min/m2.

After catheterization, the patient was taken to the Coronary
Care Unit with an intra-aortic balloon pump and was diuresed
approximately 15 liters in the Coronary Care Unit with
intravenous Lasix.  He was transferred back to the Cardiology
Service for continued diuresis.  He was started on a heart
failure regimen of captopril 50 mg p.o. t.i.d., Lasix 120 mg
p.o. b.i.d., Aldactone 25 mg p.o. q.d., carvedilol 3.125 mg
p.o. b.i.d.  He was also started on a statin, Lipitor 10 mg
p.o. q.d.

He was seen by the Electrophysiology Service for the
possibility of receiving a prophylactic automatic internal
cardioverter-defibrillator.  Given the fact that this was not
an ischemic cardiomyopathy, it was felt that it was not
indicated at this point.

2.  DIABETES:  He was continued on his diabetic regimen.

3.  FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION:  Electrolytes were
repleted on a p.r.n. basis given his aggressive ongoing
diuresis.

4.  DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient remained on the
Cardiology Service as of [**7-18**].  An addendum to this
Discharge Summary will be dictated by the incoming intern.

ADDENDUM:  Under cardiovascular, please add that the patient
was discharged with amiodarone due to three events of
nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (at most four beats) on
the night of [**2167-7-21**].  Per consultation with Dr
[**Last Name (STitle) 86**] of the elctrophysiology service, it was not thought
that he that he required an automatic internal
cardioverter-defibrillator due
to the fact that his cardiomyopathy is global without apparent
post infarct areas of scar.

Also initiated was a formal full workup for a possible heart
transplant candidacy.  Some of these results of this workup
were still pending.

Under fluids/electrolytes/nutrition, please add that the
patient was aggressively diuresed while in the hospital and
discharged and nearly euvolemic.

Under discharge condition, please add that the patient was
discharged in stable condition to home with a Holter monitor
and an appointment to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in two weeks and
instructions to keep a diary of his daily urine output.  His
dental records were also requested to be faxed to
Dr.[**Name (NI) 7878**] office concerning a tooth abscess.

Under medications on discharge, he was discharged on
captopril 75 mg p.o. t.i.d., atorvastatin 10 mg p.o. q.d.,
carvedilol 6.25 mg p.o. b.i.d., Lasix 120 mg p.o. b.i.d.,
insulin as directed, enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.,
Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d., spironolactone 25 mg p.o. q.d.,
amiodarone 400 mg p.o. q.d.

Also, under laboratories, also include human immunodeficiency
virus antibody negative, hepatitis B surface antigen and
hepatitis B surface antibody were negative.  Hepatitis C was
negative.  VCV titer was positive.  Cytomegalovirus was
negative.  Toxo was negative.

Under physical examination, add that on discharge the
patient's extremities had minimal edema in the left lower
extremity and 1 to 2+ edema in the right lower extremity.

Angiography showed SFA occluded and occluded popliteal above the
knee.  PTA was done of the mid popliteal with dissection of the
politeal below the knee, which was stented.  Post procedure, he
ruled in for NSTEMI and suffered cardiogenic shock.  He was on
pressors, natrecor, and intubated.  Subsequently, the leg
worsened, becoming cool and cyanotic.  He was then referred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

At [**Hospital1 18**], he underwent cardiac catheterization with stenting of

Brief Hospital Course:
1) CAD:

Suffered NSTEMI at outside hospital, c/b cardiogenic shock.
He underwent cardiac catheterization with placement of stent of
LAD here.

Cardiac catheterization revealed the following:

-left dominant coronary anatomy
-LMCA: distal taper of 40%
-LAD: origin 80% lesion with serial 80% lesion in proximal LAD
      with moderate diffuse disease in the LAD
-LCX: dominant vesel with moderate diffuse disease
-RCA: non-dominant vessel with moderate diffuse disease

-LSFA: diffuse disease from the FA to the stent; stents are
occluded without reconstitution distally; there are mild
geniculated collaterals to the infrapopliteal arteries without
named vessels below.

He was medically managed with ASA, plavix, beta blocker, and
statin, ace inhibitor.
He remained stable. Please continue medications on discharge.

2) Pump:

He was felt to be euvolemic.  There were no signs/symptoms
of CHF despite receiving free water to correct his hyponatremia.

He had an echo performed on [**1-18**], which demonstrated the
following:

-mild dilation of the left atrium
-mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal LV
cavity size
-overall LVEF preserved  = 55%
-noted basal inferior hypokinesis
-Mitral valve leaflets mildly thickened
-trivial mitral regurgitation

3) Acute/chronic renal insufficiency:

Acute exacerbation of chronic renal insufficiency; felt to be
secondary to
contrast nephropathy following multiple procedures.  Creatinine
peaked at 5.7,
and trended down to 1.5, which may be his new baseline level.

4)Hypernatremia:

Resolved with Free water deficit replaced. Encouraging PO free
h2o.

4) DM2:

He was monitored with finger sticks glucose checks and covered
with sliding scale insulin. BG levels not well controlled and
remained b/w 250-300. He was not on outpt oral medications but
started on glipizide 2.5mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**2118-2-1**] which improved BG
control.

5) [**Date Range **]:

He has a significant history of peripheral [**Date Range 1106**] disease, and
is
now s/p intervention followed by left CFA-DP bypass for this.
As [**Date Range 1106**] surgery was concerned for infection of hematoma on
his
left calf,he was started on antibiotic coverage including
vanc/levo/flagyl. Culture sent and revealed no growth. No
microorganisms seen. His antibiotics were changed to keflex and
levofloxacin on [**2118-2-2**] for empiric coverage. These should be
continued for 1 week (last dose on [**2118-2-9**]). ACE on calf at all
times. He will need toe amputation as an outpatient. He is to
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from podiatry on [**2-9**] regarding 4th toe
amputation and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 57956**] on [**2-9**] for r/u after surgery.
At that time, he will have staples removed and discuss whether
or not to continue antibiotics.

[**1-18**]: concern for RUE edema and infiltration of IV site.
Plastic surgery was consulted. No compartment syndrome. He has
been keeping R arm elevated, as per recs. Also continue [**Hospital1 **]
dressing changes with xeroform over blisters until resolve. Much
improvement. Swelling/ecchymosis cont to decrease.

6) Mental Status:

Baseline level of dementia/cognitive impairment, complicated by
acute
delirium.  Neurology was involved; head CT was negative for
bleed. Attempts
at lumbar puncture failed.  Altered mental status was felt to be
secondary to
sedative medications. As these meds were held, his mental status
progressively
improved back toward baseline.  Still has some short-term memory
deficits which will likely improve with time, but if they don't
will require further neurologic evaluation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 19688**] was admitted and underwent cardiac catheterization.
During the procedure, the right coronary artery could not be
engaged as there was a significant amount (approximately 7mm) of
previously placed stent jutting out into the lumen of the aorta.
The right coronary artery appeared to have a severe ostial
stenosis despite the presence of the previously placed multiple
stents. The LMCA, LAD and LCx had no angiographic evidence of
coronary artery disease. Distal aortography was also performed.
This demonstrated a large plaque in the aorta just distal to the
renal arteries.  There was mild-moderate arterial disease in the
right and left iliac arteries and mild arterial disease in the
right common femoral artery. Based on the above results, cardiac
surgery was consulted and further evaluation was performed. An
echocardiogram on [**1-1**] was notable for 2+ mitral
regurgitation and depressed left ventricular function with an
ejection fraction of 30%. Preoperative evaluation was otherwise
unremarkable and she was cleared for surgery.

On [**1-2**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed single vessel coronary
artery bypass grafting along with a mitral valve repair. He also
removed the stent from the right coronary ostium via aortotomy.
The operation was otherwise uneventful and she transferred to
the CSRU for invasive monitoring. Within 24 hours, she awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated. She maintained stable
hemodynamics as she weaned from inotropic support. She
intermittently required intravenous Nitroglycerin for
hypertension. Given her cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular
disease, her SBP was maintained between 120-140 mmHg. She
remained mostly in a normal sinus rhythm. Very briefs episodes
of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation were noted on telemetry, most
likely in the setting of hypokalemia. K and Mg levles were
monitored closely and repleted per protocol. Most of her
preoperative medications were resumed. She made steady progress
and transferred to the SDU on postoperative five. Her blood
sugars remained well controlled. Beta blockade was slowly
advanced as tolerated. She remained in a normal sinus rhythm
without further episodes of atrial fibrillation. Over several
days, she continued to make clinical improvements with diuresis
and made steady progress with physical therapy. She was cleared
for discharge to rehab on postoperative day seven. At discharge,
her chest x-ray showed resolution of pulmonary edema with
decreased left basilar atelectasis. Her BP ranged from the
104-114/50-60's with a heart rate in the 70-80's. Her room air
saturations were 95%. All surgical wounds were clean, dry and
intact without evidence of infection. She had adequate pain
control with Tramadol and Motrin. She was discharged to rehab in
stable condition on POD#8.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 72 yo woman with progressive mitral regurgitation and
severe right coronary artery disease s/p multiple interventions
including successful stenting [**5-1**] now in need of optimization
of her medical program.
.
1. Coronary Artery Disease: Ostial RCA lesion was successfully
intervened upon [**5-1**].  The patient had an episode of exertional
dyspnea on ambulating to the bathroom earlier today but is
currently free of CP and dyspnea and doing well.  Troponin bump
[**5-2**] likely due to intervention [**5-1**].
  - Continue ASA, metoprolol, atorvastatin
  - Clopidogrel 75 mg daily x9 months
  - Added ACE-inhibitor after stenting and renal function
stable. Titrated up to 10 mg po daily and tolerated by BP.
  - Troponin and CK peaked at 1.04 and 109, have since trended
downwards.
.
2. Stroke: The patient has a known old right-sided stroke and
carotid and intracranial stenoses. At baseline, she has
bilateral upgoing toes, left facial droop, and general
left-sided sensory loss.  There are no new neurologic deficits.
Followed by neurology consultation service as inpatient.
Continue ASA, clopidogrel.
.
3. Mitral Regurgitation: Although coronary ischemia was likely
playing a role in her dyspnea, her MR is likely contributing as
well.  MR has been thought to be due to papillary muscle
stunning in the setting of myocardial ischemia as opposed to
intrinsic valvular defect.
  - Afterload reduced with lisinopril as noted above
  - No current plans for MVR
  - Goal fluid balance roughly even
.
4. DM-II: Continue RISS, insulini 70/30 [**Hospital1 **].
.
5. HTN: Control with meds as above.
.
6. NSVT: No further events on telemetry.
.
7. Asthma: Continue fluticasone/salmeterol, ipratropium.
.
8. Depression: Continue sertraline.
.
9. Neuropathic Pain: Continue gabapentin.
.
10. F/E/N: Cardiac diet/[**Doctor First Name **], check lytes daily.
.
11. Proph: heparin sq, bowel regimen, PPI.
.
12. Code: Full code, but patient has stated, ""I don't want to be
on machines for a long time."" HCP are pt's children.
.
13. Disposition: Pt stable and improved. PT recommending
rehabilitation, from which patient will benefit.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9454**]
Chief Complaint:
foot pain, fevers, sepsis, cardiogenic shock

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Chief complaint: Transferred from [**Hospital3 417**] for management
of acute on chronic congestive heart failure.
.
History of present illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname 19688**] is a 76 year-old
Portuguese-speaking woman with insulin dependent diabetes,
hyperlipidemia, cerebrovascular disease (with stroke), COPD,
depression, GERD, heart failure (LVEF 20%) and chronic renal
failure presenting to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital with generalized
weakness, possible abdominal pain, and leg and right foot pain.
Today she is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for management of fluid
overload.
.
The discharge summary from [**Hospital3 417**] mentions that she was
suffering from gout with treatment begun in the nursing home,
abdominal CT to assess ?abdominal pain, and generalized
weakness. She had also presented with a creatinine of 2.2 and it
appears that fluid resuscitation was commenced that has now
reduced her creatinine but worsened her heart failure. In her
summary, lower extremity pain was attributed to vascular disease
and possibly in need of vascular studies and intervention. She
is also to be worked-up for acute causes of heart failure. CT
scan of the right kidney is suggestive of pyelonephritis that
has so far been treated with Levaquin (renal dosing). While
in-house at [**Hospital3 **]. one blood culture bottle was positive for
staphlococcus but this was atributed to contamination. Another
set from [**2129-8-17**] was negative at the time of transfer. CXR was
suspicious for infiltration of the lower lobes.
.
Per the patient: There was no joint tap to diagnose gout. OSH
records state that she was given allopurinol two weeks ago in
the nursing home for suspected gout along with colchicine
(unclear if renally dosed). She is mostly concerned for the pain
in her right foot which is the reason she gave for her admission
to [**Hospital3 417**]. She says that it had become painful in the
nursing home and that she could no longer stand on it. She has
trouble walking due to her left hemiparesis, and now with foot
and bilateral leg pain.

Pertinent Results:
IMAGING:
.
[**2129-9-7**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Minimal pulmonary edema in the presence
of mild cardiomegaly. No new consolidation.
.
[**2129-9-5**] Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 15-20 %).
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending
and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses
or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully
excluded due to suboptimal image quality. Moderate (2+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The aortic regurgitation jet is
eccentric, directed toward the anterior mitral leaflet. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully
excluded due to suboptimal image quality. There is moderate
thickening of the mitral valve chordae. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully
excluded due to suboptimal image quality. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of vegetation or abscess. Severe global
LV hypokinesis. The lateral wall has relatively better function.
The ventricle appears dyssynchronous. Moderate mitral, aortic
and tricuspid regurgitation (all may be UNDERestimated due to
acoustic shadowing from widespread calcification). Moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2129-8-22**],
overall ejection fraction is probably slightly less. Degree of
aortic regurgitation has increased, degrees of mitral and
tricuspid regurgitation probably similar. Estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressures are higher.
.
[**2129-9-3**] CT chest/abdomen/pelvis:
CHEST:
Trace pleural fluid is present bilaterally with minimal
dependent bibasilar atelectasis. Images are somewhat degraded
due to respiratory motion artifact; however, there is no
consolidation. Small amount of fluid is present in the dependent
portion of the central trachea. Cardiomegaly and heavy coronary
arterial calcifications and atherosclerotic calcification of the
thoracic aorta is unchanged. There is no mediastinal or axillary
lymphadenopathy. Median sternotomy wires
are in place.
.
ABDOMEN:
The liver, spleen, adrenals, and kidneys are within normal
limits. Numerous surgical clips in the gallbladder fossa and at
the posterior aspect of the right hepatic lobe from previous
cholecystectomy are again seen. There is no biliary ductal
dilatation. The pancreas is within normal limits. There is
diffuse atherosclerotic calcification of the abdominal aorta,
aortic branches, and intrarenal vascular calcifications are
noted. Right femoropopliteal arterial graft is again noted.
There are no peritoneal fluid collections. There is a large
amount of stool in the rectum, descending colon, and distal
transverse colon. There is no small- bowel obstruction. A normal
appendix is noted. There is no bowel wall thickening or
pneumatosis.
.
PELVIS:
The urinary bladder is collapsed about a Foley catheter balloon.
Focus of air in the nondependent portion of the bladder is
likely related to Foley catheter placement. Again seen is a
calcified uterine fibroid. There are no adnexal masses. There
are no pelvic fluid collections.
.
ABDOMINAL WALL:
Numerous areas of infiltration of the subcutaneous fat in the
anterior
abdominal wall, few foci of subcutaneous air are likely related
to injection sites.
.
BONES:
Multilevel degenerative changes of the thoracic and lumbar spine
are
unchanged. Compression deformity of the superior endplate of L1
is unchanged. Right glenohumeral joint degenerative change and
mild bilateral hip osteoarthritis is noted.
.
IMPRESSION:
1. No pneumonia, as questioned.
2. No abdominal or pelvic collections. No findings suggestive of
ischemic
colitis.
.
[**2129-9-3**] CT head:
FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect,
shift of normally midline structures, or edema. The ventricles
and cerebral sulci remain prominent, compatible with age-related
involutional change. Periventricular regions of hypodensity are
unchanged, consistent with small vessel ischemic change.
Bilateral basal ganglia calcifications are again noted. The
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation remains normal. Chronic left
basal ganglia, thalamic and left frontal infarcts are unchanged.
Mastoid air cells are hypoplastic. The paranasal sinuses are
otherwise well aerated.
.
IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage.
.
[**2129-8-26**] CTA lower extremities
IMPRESSION:
1. Occluded left superficial femoral artery with reconstitution
at the
popliteal. Complete occlusion of the left posterior tibial
artery with
severely diseased, but patent anterior tibial and peroneal
arteries.
2. Patent fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass graft on the right with stable severe
narrowing at the insertion of the bypass graft into the
popliteal artery. Occluded native superficial femoral artery on
the right. Evaluation for the runoff to the lower right leg is
limited as the entire lower leg is not visualized on this study.
However, it does appear that the posterior tibial artery is
occluded on this side.

Brief Hospital Course:
76 yo F with MMP including CHF and PAD, initially admitted for
foot pain, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] and felt to be in acute on
chronic CHF (EF 20%), s/p aggressive diuresis, now presenting
with intermittent fevers without source, progressive altered
mental status, noted to be in oliguric acute renal failure, and
in early sepsis.
.
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:
In brief, 76 yo F with MMP, admitted [**2129-8-20**] to [**Hospital3 **]
Hospital for foot pain. She was empirically started on
colchicine and allopurinol, despite lack of gout hx or joint
tap. She was noted to be in ARF (Cr 2.2, baseline 1.2 in [**2127**]).
Some concern for pyelo, despite normal U/A. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for heart failure. Admitted to [**Hospital1 1516**] service, where she was
aggressively diuresed total of 10L over next several days. Cr
started to rise and 1.6-1.8.  Pt spiked on [**2129-8-23**] and WBC 11.
Left leg appeared red. Neg LENI's. Started on vanco and cipro
for cellulitis. Switched to vanc and ceftriaxone given hx of
cipro resistant E.coli at the site of her fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass in the
past. On [**8-26**], underwent CTA with contrast, seen by vascular,
and planned for angio procedure, given concern for ischemia in
leg. On [**9-21**], triggered for ?encephalopathy and AMS. On
[**8-30**], CT head negative for hemorrhage. NGT placed for concern
for inability to take in PO. On [**9-3**], triggered again, this time
unresponsive and tachycardic. Concern for SIRS/sepsis given BP
90/50, HR 130, and transferred to MICU. Given fluid boluses,
started on vanco/cefepime/flagyl. CT chest/abd/pelvis without
consolidation or fluid collections. Echo neg for vegetations.
Pancultured without source. On [**9-4**], given fluid boluses for low
UOP. On [**9-5**], had neg TTE study again, given concern for
intermittent temp spikes. After discussion with ICU team,
patient DNR/DNI. On [**9-7**], spiked again and WBC to 23, with
lactate rising (now 4.5). Discussion with family re: goals of
care, and family wished to pursue comfort measures.
.
DETAILED HOSPITAL COURSE:
.
[**Hospital1 **] COURSE:
# Acute on chronic heart failure/fluid overload: felt to be
significantly fluid overloaded from aggressive hydration in OSH
and perhaps earlier, given her poor systolic heart function.
Physical exam significant for basilar crackles, raised JVP,
significant edema throughout. CXR imaging noting pulmonary
edema, without signs of infection. Other acute causes of pump
dysfunction were considered including myocardial
ischemia/infarction, medication error, colchicine, thyroid
disease, anemia, atrial fibrillation. Patient initially started
on sodium restriction, fluid restriction, lasix drip 15 mg/hr,
metolazone (5 mg PO BID). EKG, cardiac enzymes, and TSH were
non-revealing. Echo was performed showing, ""severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis with relative preservation of the basal
anterior septum and inferolateral walls. The remaining segments
are severely hypokinetic (LVEF = 25 %). Mild to moderate ([**12-10**]+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of
moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension."" Patient diuresed approximately 10L.
.
## Lower and right foot pain: Possible etiologies felt to
include arterial insufficency, DVT, severe edema secondary to
acute on chronic renal and heart failure as well as
hypoalbuminemia, possibly with neuropathic contribution. Gout is
possible, but the appearance of the feet and distribution of
pain are not consistent with monoarticular or oligoarticular
gout, particularly not the great toe. DVT is possible but seen
as less likely given bilateral symmetry and given the the degree
of edema is somewhat in keeping with that of her hand and other
signs such as crackles, raised JVP. Arterial insufficiency is
also possible as is diabetic neuropathy. Initial workup
consisted of LENI's (negative for DVT), and treatment for
cellultis (started on vanco and cipro, switched to vanc and
ceftriaxone given hx of cipro resistant E.coli at the site of
her fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass in the past). CTA lower extremities performed
showing occluded left superficial femoral artery with
reconstitution at the popliteal. Complete occlusion of the left
posterior tibial artery with severely diseased, but patent
anterior tibial and peroneal arteries. Patent fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass
graft on the right with stable severe narrowing at the insertion
of the bypass graft into the popliteal artery. Occluded native
superficial femoral artery on the right. Evaluation for the
runoff to the
lower right leg is limited as the entire lower leg is not
visualized on this
study. However, it does appear that the posterior tibial artery
is occluded
on this side. It was felt that patient's leg pain was largely
from PAD/PVD/lower extremity ischemia, and vascular was
consulted. However, angiogram was not performed, given
co-morbidities and remainder of hospital course.
.
## Renal failure: multifactorial, and likely from medications,
impaired forward flow from heart failure, being physiologically
pre-renal despite fluid overload, contrast nephropathy and
possibly ATN.
.
## Confusion/altered mental status: unclear but felt to be toxic
metabolic in setting of elevated BUN. Head CT negative for
CVA/ICH. Diuresis was held at this point.
.
MICU COURSE:
Ms. [**Known lastname 19688**] is a 76 yo female w/ multiple medical problems,
transferred to MICU for further management of presumed sepsis.
.
# Sepsis: Patient re-developed fevers on [**9-2**] on a regimen of
vancomycin / ceftriaxone. Patient had no previous positive
cultures since [**2129-8-20**]. Initial concern for infectious
etiologies included the following:
*** Intra-abdominal: given pain on palpation, and fevers while
on broad spectrum gram positive coverage with somewhat limited
gram negative/anaerobic coverage. Initial differential included
C. diff colitis, mesenteric ischemia (given multiple
vasculopathies, elevated lactate), abscess.  However, CT torso
was negative and pain resolved with disimpaction and bowel
regimen. Patient was intermittently started on flagyl which was
discontinued after the negative imaging.
*** Urine: there was initial concern for renal abscess given
prior history of pyelonephritis; however, CT was negative.
*** Graft site infection of right fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] graft site: given
right foot pain and history of resistant E. coli/ MRSA at the
wound site. In ICU, antibiotics were initially broadened for
gram negative coverage to cefepime to cover pseudomonas.
Infectious disease was consulted who.  Drug induced fever was
considered.
.
# Volume status/Chronic systolic HF: as evidenced by her ABGs
and electrolyte profile, she may have been over-diuresed at time
of admission to MICU. Diuresis was held and the patient was
provided fluids.  Her ACE was also held given hypotension.
.
# Peripheral arterial disease: will follow up vascular surgery
recs re: need for angio once hemodynamically stable.
.
# Insulin dependent diabetes: continued ISS with fingersticks

# Hypertension: held antihypertensives while managing sepsis
.
# Peripheral arterial disease: s/p recent right fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass
graft c/b wound infections with MRSA/E. coli requiring prolonged
courses of vanc/cefazolin/aztreonam-->linezolid/cephpodoxime
(for cipro resistant E. coli). Then minocycline for MRSA
suppression lifelong.
.
GENERAL WARDS:
# Altered mental status: after discussion with family and
extensive chart review, markedly off baseline. At baseline,
patient alert, oriented, and conversant. Now has had progressive
decline in mental status to the point that she is no longer
verbal. Has had trigger for same event for unresponsiveness. DDX
includes toxic metabolic (uremia) vs. infectious (though culture
negative to date) vs. CVA/ICH (CT negative). Most likely
etiology felt to be toxic metabolic. Nephrology was consulted,
but given other co-morbidities, goals of care were discussed in
parallel with potential dialysis.
.
# Oliguric acute renal failure: likely multifactorial in the
setting of sepsis, cardiorenal syndrome (at baseline with poor
EF), contrast/dye load (given [**2129-8-26**]), overdiuresis
([**Date range (1) 42498**]), and then decreased PO intake ([**Date range (1) 26417**]). Baseline
Cr 1.2, then has been progressively increasing. Now holding
diuresis. Currently BUN 118, Cr 2.1. Renal consulted, and goals
of care discussed.
.
# SIRS/early sepsis: patient with intermittent fevers without
source throughout hospital stay. On morning of [**9-7**], lactate
4.4, patient tachycardic and tachypnic, and low grade fevers.
Repeat lactate > 6. With regard to source, suspect overt
infection as opposed to occult infection, given jump in WBC from
13.5 to 23.4. Suspect Cdiff or bacteremia despite previous
negative blood cultures/negative micro. Started on PO flagyl (in
addition to previous IV vanco and cefepime). Goals of care
discussed with family and HCP. Family and HCP elected to make
patient [**Name (NI) 3225**]. Palliative care and pastoral care services offered.
Family at bedside when patient passed.

"25000",321,192097,Discharge summary,"Admission Date:  [**2190-3-1**]       Discharge Date:  [**2190-3-5**]

Date of Birth:   [**2113-12-13**]       Sex:  F

Service:  MICU

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 76-year-old woman admitted
to the hospital for elective hip surgery, open reduction and
internal fixation of the left hip, status post hip fracture
in [**2189-5-30**], coming again as an inpatient for elective
surgery for revision due to nonunion of the fracture.  The
patient had the surgery on [**3-1**], without any
complications, intraop blood loss of 900.

On postop day #2, the patient was noted to have altered
mental status per nursing and daughter.  The patient was not
responding to commands, and was not answering questions
appropriately, and did recognize family members.  The patient
also was noted to be in atrial fibrillation with a rapid
ventricular response rate in the 120s.  Given these two
conditions, the patient was transferred to the MICU service.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Pertinent for hypertension; obesity;
status post pacemaker for sick sinus syndrome in [**2186**]; CVA x
2, first in [**2182**], a second in [**2183**], affecting the left side
with minimal permanent deficits; osteoarthritis; GERD, status
post intestinal bypass; as well as appendectomy; and
cholecystectomy, as well as a hernia repair; depression;
fibromyalgia; diabetes mellitus, baseline.

ALLERGIES:  Sulfa with which she gets a rash.

OUTPATIENT MEDS:  Include atenolol 50 mg qd, perphenazine
37.5 mg po bid, and Tagamet, aspirin.

INITIAL EXAM:  The patient was not alert and oriented, was
not answering questions, or following commands.  Vitals -
97.6, heart rate 92-117, BP 156/70, respiratory rate 16,
satting 96% on room air.  In general, she was in no apparent
distress.  Oropharynx was clear.  Pupils equally round and
reactive to light.  Mucous membranes were dry.  No bruits on
neck.  Chest - anterior chest with coarse breath sounds.
Cardiology - irregularly, irregular, borderline tachycardic.
Abdomen was mildly distended, good bowel sounds, nontender.
Extremities - good distal pulses.  Neuro exam - again, not
alert and oriented, 1+ reflexes diffusely, good muscle tone,
unable to answer questions.

LABORATORY DATA:  The patient's hematocrit was 28.4, repeat
25.5, white blood cell count not elevated.  Chem-7 141,
sodium 4.7, potassium 110, chloride 22, bicarb 26, creatinine
1.4.  All three sets of cardiac enzymes were negative.  INR
1.3, PT 14, PTT 27.6.  ABG 7.34, carbon dioxide 40, and
oxygen 115.  UA was noted to have [**3-3**] white blood cells, with
occasional bacteria.  Urine culture showed no growth.  Hip
culture on [**3-2**] showed no growth to date.  Chest x-ray had
ventricular enlargement and possible early CHF.  EKG had
atrial fibrillation.

ISSUES - 1) MENTAL STATUS CHANGES:  Most likely secondary to
narcotic overuse.  The patient was given 3 tabs po percocet,
as well as 2 mg of IV dilaudid.  There was a question of
stroke versus subdural versus infection.  CT scan of the head
was negative.  The patient remained afebrile.  Urine culture
was negative.  Blood culture pending.  Again, the patient
responded very well during the hospital course in terms of
mental status changes resolved.  The patient, upon dispo, is
clear mentally, back to baseline.

2) ATRIAL FIBRILLATION:  Blood pressure has been stable, but
because of a rapid ventricular response was given Lopressor
pushes, and then finally po atenolol to keep her heart rate
within normal limits.  The patient was on telemetry.  The
patient was started on anticoagulation of IV heparin, will be
D/C on Lovenox and then coumadin 4 mg until she is
therapeutic.

3) LOW HEMATOCRIT:  Likely secondary to blood loss, given the
900 blood loss.  Stool guaiac negative.  Post-transfusion,
her crit has been stable for 24 hours.

4) HIP FRACTURE:  She will continue Lovenox anticoagulation,
as well as continue physical therapy, going to [**Hospital **] Rehab.
She has a right subclavian in terms of access which will be
D/C.  She was full code, and we were in communications with
the daughter.

Brief Hospital Course:
80 year old male with DM, recurrent UTI, Paget's, s/p recent
subdural hematoma evacuation admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] w/ respiratory
failure found to have MRSA pna VRE urosepsis, now improved,
called out of [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] to medicine.
.
# Respiratory distress: Patient was in acute respiratory
distress on admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  He was noted to have thick
bloody secretions on deep suctioning with visible food
particles.  He was intubated and a bronchoscopy was performed on
[**6-18**] which showed inflamed friable mucosa with moderately thick
mucous in the LLL bronchus.  No foreign body was visualized and
a BAL was sent for culture.
His acute respiratory distress was attributed to aspiration PNA
and urosepsis, however, his CXR on [**6-19**] was concerning for
possible ARDS.  He was started on protective ARDS vent settings.
 He was extubated successfully on [**6-20**].  His sputum culture
eventually grew MRSA and patient was continued on Linezolid for
coverage of MRSA PNA and VRE UTI.  Pt also developed pulmonary
edema from fluids that were received, and received lasix for
diuresis with good effects.  Pt's O2 was weaned as tolerated. At
the time of dicharge, pt was satting at 95% on RA.
.
# VRE urosepsis/aspiration, MRSA pneumonia: Patient was admitted
to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for sepsis given hypotension, hypoxia, tachycardia,
fever and leukocytosis. The pt was noted to have a UTI.  A
culture sent from the ED grew out enterococcus and patient was
noted to have bibasilar consolidations R > L accompanied by
small-to-moderate pleural effusions concerning for PNA.  Patient
was started on Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, and Zosyn.
Blood cultures were sent from the ED remained NGTD.  However,
urine cx returned positive for VRE, and patient was started on
Linezolid IV for coverage of his MRSA PNA and VRE UTI.  The BAL
also came back + for MRSA which is covered by linezolid.
Attempted to d/c foley and pt unable to void after trial and
foley was replaced. Will need another voiding trial after
treatment of UTI.
.
# Hypotension:  Patient arrived from the ED on Levophed.  He was
aggressively fluid resuscitated and he was weaned off the
levophed on [**6-19**].  It was noted that the patient was developing
a non-gap hyperchloremic acidosis from the normal saline which
had been used for volume resusciation so his IVF was changed to
lactated ringers with good resolution.  On [**6-18**] he failed his
[**Last Name (un) 104**] stim test and was started on stress-dose steroids.  His
blood pressure stablized and his steroids were continued.  IV
steroid was switched to po and po steroids tapered to off on
[**6-24**].
.
# Mental status changes:  Patient is s/p subdural hematoma
evacuation.  It is unclear what his baseline mental status is
although per report, he is able to follow commands, and there
was a notable decline which in part tiggered this admission.
Likely etiology of new decline in mental status is infection.
Given his past history of CVA, heparin SC was withheld.  Patient
was continued on his seizure prophylaxis with Phenytoin
(currently 9.0; goal [**10-29**]) for his history of subdural
hematoma. He should be continued on this for an additional 2
weeks.
.
# DM: Patient was maintained on an ISS.
.
FEN: Patient was NPO while intubated.  Nutrition was consulted
and tube feeding was initiated on [**6-18**]. Pt self discontinued his
NGT and a swallow study was performed. The video swallow showed
no aspiration but pt should have pills crushed for pocketing. In
addition, he does not have teeth and therefore should cont on
pureed solids. Pt was taking poor PO and had another family
discussion about PEG tube placement. Family does not want a PEG
tube but this should be readdressed with family if pt continues
to take poor PO. Daughter will address with her family. Pt was
started on Megace on [**6-24**].

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 75 year old female
with a history of noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus and
congestive heart failure who presented to the outside
hospital on [**2191-10-23**], with complaints of increasing lethargy,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, lower
extremity swelling over two weeks and was found to be in
diabetic ketoacidosis with a fasting blood sugar of 700. The
patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit.

Within 24 hours of admission, she was thought to be volume
overloaded from overt congestive heart failure and was
started on Captopril and Lasix for diuresis.  She then
developed relative hypotension with a blood pressure of
80/40.  The echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of
20% with hypokinesis and apical akinesis. Heparin was started
for apical akinesis.

Bilateral thoracentesis was performed for approximately 1500
ccs of fluid removed with symptomatic relief.  On [**2191-10-27**],
Captopril was discontinued and Dopamine was initiated to aid
with hypotension and diuresis.  On [**2191-10-31**], Dopamine was
weaned off and Captopril was restarted.  The patient was
noted to be hyponatremic with a sodium of 121 and lethargic
on examination.

On [**2191-11-1**], she again developed hypotension with a systolic
blood pressure of 70 to 80.  Lasix and Captopril were held
without improvement. Over the next few days, she remained
relatively hypotensive and the plan was for transfer to [**Hospital1 1444**] for cardiac catheterization.
Of note, she had elevated white blood cell count on admission
to the outside hospital.  She was started on Ciprofloxacin
for a urinary tract infection.

She was admitted directly to the CCU at [**Hospital1 190**].  At that time, she was pain free with minimal
dyspnea.  No complaints aside from low back pain which is
chronic.  The son was present for translating as the patient
speaks only Armanian.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Chronic cervical spine disease.
4.  Congestive heart failure.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Unavailable.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No drugs, alcohol or tobacco.  She lives
with her son.  She is Armanian speaking.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs on admission revealed
temperature 97.5, blood pressure 98/50, pulse 80, respiratory
rate 16, oxygen saturation 97% on two liters via nasal
cannula.  In general, this is an elderly female in no acute
distress.   Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat - normocephalic
and atraumatic.  The pupils are equal, round, and reactive to
light and accommodation.  Extraocular movements are intact.
The oropharynx is clear.  The neck reveals no
lymphadenopathy, jugular venous pressure was 12 centimeters,
trachea midline.  Pulmonary - decreased breath sounds at both
bases approximately one fourth of the lung fields, minimal
rales, no wheeze.  Cardiovascular - regular rate and rhythm,
S1 and S2 and S3, no murmur.  The abdomen is soft, nontender,
nondistended, normoactive bowel sounds, no
hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities were warm, 1+ pitting edema
with pulses intact.  Central nervous system - the patient was
alert and oriented times three, conversant, nonfocal motor
and sensory examination.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white blood cell count 10.9,
hematocrit 34.6, platelets 176,000.  Sodium 126, potassium
3.7, chloride 88, CO2 34, blood urea nitrogen 21, creatinine
0.6, glucose 220.  Partial thromboplastin time 39, INR 2.5.

Electrocardiogram on [**2191-10-23**], showed normal sinus rhythm at
120 with right axis deviation, intraventricular conduction
delay, 1.[**Street Address(2) 2811**] elevation V2 with 1.[**Street Address(2) 2811**]
depressions in leads I, aVL, V5 and V6.  There were small Q
waves in the lead III, as well as T wave inversion.

On [**2191-11-6**], electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at
80 beats per minute with right axis deviation and
intraventricular conduction delay.  There was less than 1.[**Street Address(2) 27948**] depression in lead V6.

Chest x-ray showed right pleural effusion.  Echocardiogram
showed ejection fraction of less than 20% and apical
thrombus, global left ventricular hypokinesis and apical
akinesis.  There was moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.

IMPRESSION:  This is a 75 year old female with noninsulin
dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia and congestive heart failure who
presented with diabetic ketoacidosis and non ST elevation
myocardial infarction.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for management of cardiogenic versus
hypovolemic shock.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Cardiovascular - Coronary arteries - On the basis of
electrocardiogram, she was felt to have had a non ST
elevation myocardial infarction, probably a week or two prior
to presentation to the outside hospital.  Troponin was 3.0 on
admission to the outside hospital although the CK MB was
normal.  There was no history of chest pain.

Given no evidence for immediately recent ischemia and the low
likelihood of significant improvement, even with
revascularization, it was felt that the risks of cardiac
catheterization outweighed the potential benefits.

Allergies to Aspirin was addressed and appears to be actually
a fear of gastritis, and thus daily Aspirin was initiated.
She was continued on Lipitor.

Congestive heart failure/hemodynamics - The patient presented
with congestive heart failure and hypotension requiring
Levophed for pressure support.  This was weaned three days
after admission.  The patient remained relatively hypotensive
with systolic pressures ranging from 75 to 99.  Saline
boluses were administered and the systolic blood pressure
increased to 91 to 115.

However, urine output remained low and there was worsening
congestive heart failure with oxygen saturation decreasing to
96% on four liters.  Aldactone 25 mg p.o. q.d. was started.
On [**2191-11-9**], she was considered stable and transferred from
the CCU to the cardiology floor.

Repeat chest x-ray showed worsening bilateral pleural
effusions and congestive heart failure.  Therapeutic
thoracentesis was not performed because this had been already
done at the outside hospital and fluid had rapidly
reaccumulated.  Instead, gentle diuresis was attempted with
Lasix 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. Her fluid balance was slightly
negative for several consecutive days on this dose but her
weight slowly increased daily.  Her lower extremity edema did
not improve appreciably.

She also became more alkalotic as well as hyponatremic to the
low 120s although she did not exhibit mental status changes.
Her blood pressure remained tenuous at one point measuring
74/50 four days prior to discharge.

In general though, her blood pressure was about 90 to 110
over 60 to 70.  Her oxygen saturation was stable at 94 to 96%
on four liters.  The day before discharge Lasix was
discontinued and low dose Bumetanide was started.  We never
initiated therapy with beta blocker or ace inhibitor because
of her hypotension.  She did remain on Digoxin and we
increased her dose to 0.25 mg/0.125 mg p.o. q.d. on
alternating days.  Her Digoxin level at this dose was 1.6 to
1.8.

Rate and rhythm - There were no acute issues although she
maintained a rapid heart rate averaging in the 90s most
likely due to intravascular volume depletion, poor cardiac
output.

2.  Pulmonary - The patient was maintained on oxygen by nasal
prong at three to four liters.  She denied dyspnea except on
rare occasion.  When symptomatic, she was treated with
nebulized Albuterol and Atrovent with relief.  Further
information on her pulmonary course is listed above under
subcategory congestive heart failure.

3.  Hematology - The patient was heparinized for documented
apical thrombus and apical akinesis seen on echocardiogram at
the outside hospital.  She was started on Coumadin for a goal
INR of 2.0 to 3.0.  She was anemic and was started on Epogen
8,000 units subcutaneous q.week as well as Iron Sulfate 325
mg p.o. b.i.d.

4.  Infectious disease - The patient presented with urinary
tract infection and was treated with Levofloxacin 250 mg p.o.
q.d. for one week course.  Repeat urinalysis check at the end
of her antibiotic course was perfectly normal.

5.  Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - As documented above,
hyponatremia and alkalosis limited the extent to which we
could diurese this patient.  In addition, she tends to become
hypomagnesemic so oral supplements were administered as well
as periodic intravenous magnesium repletion.  Her potassium
tends to run high probable due to her Aldactone.  She was
admitted on oral supplements of potassium and these were
discontinued.

6.  Endocrine - We continued the patient on her NPH insulin
and covered her with regular insulin sliding scale.

7.  Prophylaxis - Heparin and Coumadin for deep vein
thrombosis prophylaxis were given as well as Protonix for
gastrointestinal prophylaxis.

8.  Code Status - Lengthy discussions were held with the
patient and her son who acted as translator.  The patient
wishes to be DNR/DNI but will accept intravenous pressors.
She wishes to reverse her Code Status to full code in the
event that a procedure such as a cardiac catheterization is
performed so that she could be resuscitated if there are
complications with the procedure.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Satisfactory.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  She was discharged to [**Hospital 13698**]
Rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Coumadin 3 mg p.o. q.d.

13. Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q4-6hours p.r.n.
14. Nebulized Albuterol and Atrovent p.r.n.

SPECIFIC DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  Her INR should be checked frequently q.d. over the next
several days as Coumadin was only started several days before
discharge.  Goal INR is 2.0 to 3.0.
2.  Sodium, magnesium and potassium should be checked
frequently.  If sodium is less than 125, consider decreasing
her diuretic.  If potassium is less than 4.0, provide oral
supplementation.  Her standing potassium was discontinued
immediately prior to discharge.  Her potassium level was 5.0
on the day prior to discharge.  Magnesium supplementation
should be provided to keep magnesium greater than 2.0.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Severe congestive heart failure.
2.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
3.  Hypotension.
4.  Urinary tract infection.
5.  Hyponatremia.
6.  Pleural effusions.
7.  Anemia.
8.  Apical thrombus.

ADDENDUM:  The expected date of discharge, which was
originally that of [**2191-11-15**], the patient was found to
be lethargic, not responsive to voice, but responsive to
painful stimulus.  A chest x-ray was performed.  This was
shown to be unchanged from prior x-ray on the [**12-9**]
that showed large bilateral pleural effusion as well as
severe pulmonary edema.  Arterial blood gas showed a pH of
7.37, PCO2 of 52 and PO2 of 158 on 100% nonrebreather.  Her
oxygen saturation was 98%.  It was thought that her lethargy
was secondary to hypercarbia.  The patient's son was notified
of her decreased mental status and it was decided to not
pursue any aggressive measures including thoracentesis or
intubation.  In fact with no treatment the patient improved
and her mental status gradually returned to baseline by that
evening.

On the following day the [**11-16**] the patient was at
baseline mental status and was discharged to rehabilitation.

There were several changes in her discharge medications.
First her Coumadin was decreased to 2 mg po q.h.s.  This was
done, because her INR on the day of discharge was 3.3.  The
goal INR is from 2.0 to 3.0.  In addition, her Digoxin was
decreased to 0.125 mg po q.d.  Due to her low sodium level
the patient should have daily fluid restrictions to
approximately 750 cc po.

She is discharged to [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation.
